In almsot every medium of online creativity there is a space for people to leave comments. These comments can grow quickly leaving the creator in a spot that makes it difficult to engage. But what if you could change that? What if you coud use machine learning and natrual language processing to serve you comments in your feed or forums that are relevent to the content, or questions people have, or group them by sentiment.
