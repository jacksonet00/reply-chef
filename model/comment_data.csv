When you were worried about applying the lighter brown under your eye, I immediately thought of Wayne Goss' brush number 08 and 07! If you don't already have them, get them!

I learned how to properly do my winged eyeliner because of you. I learned a lot from you when it comes to make up. And I’m so happy that you have 2.79M subscribers now compared to the last time I visited your channel. You deserve all the love and million subs! I love you so much! I’m so happy to watch your videos again you’re getting better at it everytime 😘❤️ I hope God will bless you more because you have a good and strong heart 💖💖💖💗💗💗

I am sincerely thankful that you decided to do video tutorials, my anxiety and my make up skills thank you from the bottom of their heart. Your voice is so calming that I could watch you even if I don’t want to learn anything about make up, ( but I do).. so I have a question .. what is the brand of the sponge you use, I feel like the ones I have don’t work or I’m doing something wrong, they are a less than $5 brand that I can’t even remember.. I hope you read this and thanks so much for sharing your tips with us! 😍

She's not wrong about the water thing... I started drinking way more water and completely dropped soda and by roughly the fourth or fifth day I noticed my skin was smoother-looking, less red and seemed to be producing a much more normal amount of oil. (My skin is combination skin, and this was with my bad consistency with a skincare routine lol)

Before work, i rush foundation, eye pencil, eye shadow (monocolor), mascara, lipstick and it takes 10 minutes at least.  Now looking at this video; eyeshadow guards, smudging eyeliner, fake lashes and already finished skin and eyebrow makeup, i am having a good laugh. No person can do that. I mean not even the girl in the video.

I've tried several drugstore eyeshadow primers, they're okay. Essence I 🤍 Stage is good enough, though I feel that it's no different from using a concealer. This is also why I haven't tried MAC paint pot 😅 HOWEVER, I do like using Maybelline Fit Me powder (compact) on my lids; and I don't experience creasing, even on creamier eyeshadows.

The darkness around your eyes is amazing. Makeup artists usually dont cover that up if they can when it's so beautifully compliments the face. Theyll put the concealer close to the eye but leave the darkness right below the eye bc it just looks so nice.

2146,"Hi, your hair looks lovely!",beauty
2147,Oh my god... I literally never thought to curl my lashes. This may be an actual game changer tbh,beauty
2148,The darkness around your eyes is amazing. Makeup artists usually dont cover that up if they can when it's so beautifully compliments the face. Theyll put the concealer close to the eye but leave the darkness right below the eye bc it just looks so nice.,beauty
2149,"You're so, naturally, gorgeous. It kills me. Ilysm. ♡♡♡",beauty
2150,Your voice is so satisfying with headphones 🤤😍😭😂,beauty

2160,Love the hair and love the natural make up look.,beauty
2161,Finally a simple natural makeup tutorial. Tired of the super heavy foundation concealer tutorials and people calling it natural looking lol,beauty
2162,"O MY GOD she is so beautiful😍the darker color hair, Love it💕",beauty

Her routine is pretty intense but in the long run, you need to have a strong disciplined skillset like hers to keep looking fresh and maintain a great appearance. She didn't look horrible without makeup in the first place and with it on, she looks refreshed. I love to see it and definitely will be picking up some of these high end products and ingraining them into my routine.

2510,"""Feel free to use Google, StackOverflow..."" ""Real"" interviewers should take note!",tech
2511,"imagine saying ""the uglier the better"" to a front end dev😂\nPs- Thanks for the 200 likes",tech
2512,Ben is doing the sassy interviewer stereotype perfectly here.,tech
2513,cool trick: \n1. Know nothing about React\n2. Watch this video\n3. Study React for a bit,tech
2514,Clement when you did map - you forgot to assign key attribute.,tech
2515,"22:00 - hmmm, did someone change the userInfo type in the userInfos.map call?",tech

2523,"useCallback instead of useRef - it memoizes the fetch function for ref equality, so the effect doesnt rerun on every render. UseCallback will mean that if you eventually do a refactor so the function does depend on some value inside the component, your compiler will yell at you until you include it as a dependency. Useref might solve the problem now, but it can hide future potential dependencies. Also, working with a ref is annoying, constantly looking up .current or forgetting to.",tech

2530,33:05 - Wrap fetchNextUser with useCallback so the function reference will be memoized between component re-renders. It's a good and efficient practice and will satisfy the linter :),tech

When trying to represent information via a color spectrum, could you please choose colors other than red and green for this reason? Red and blue are good choices because they are distinguishable by both red-green color deficient people as well as blue-yellow color deficient people, which is the second-most common form of colorblindness.

3123,"So weights in neural network work a bit like probability, right ? The more it has weight the more it is probable it has a certain pattern. Am I correct ?",tech
3124,"13:16 One thing. From the start, you're taking an image and turning it into a flat (1D) array of greyscale pixel values.

3133,"I don't know if this was addressed in the latter videos but here's the particular reason why the Sigmoid as an activation function is hard to train: when you get the derivative of the logits there will be points that will make the derivative rather close to zero (which would slow down training) as opposed to ReLU, where you get a constant value—which is easier to train.",tech

So got to find that material..i suggest maybe granite,or jasper stone, which does not corrode. But when we wake up, and after looking at the buildings, we will get bored again, then we may consider freezing again, but the world doesnt get built that fast by the second, so we cant wake up that often, unless the world could be rebuilt a new one by the second,then we will stay awake without getting bored.

The poor fitting, ad hoc dust masks won't stop the new UK virus strain and it will take several months to vaccinate everyone with a vaccine that might not work, (e.g. resistant SA or Brazil strains), or need booster shots every few months. We need improved Hazmat Level C full face and half face respirators now. The improved respirators must include a P100 filter cartridge that screws onto the exhaust valve seat to prevent virus transmission from an infected wearer. Please use the DPA and legislation to increase production of respirators designed to prevent the spread of all COVID strains and save us from these dangerous dust masks. See Hazmat Level C:

Acetaminophen is safe to take too, but would you tell someone with acute liver failure to take it? No, because it would walk you to death's door a lot sooner than intended, and has been linked as a causation of the condition after extensive study. Perhaps Lindell is using oleandrin as a sugar replacement; would explain his mentality...

""Boris"" kept saying ""disputing an election result isn't a crime, nor an impeachable offense"".

trump is being impeached for inciting the attack on The Capitol.  NOT disputing the election.

Just as every person who committed a crime during all protests, every person who committed a crime at the Capitol building on January 6th, 20201, should be held accountable.  The motivation for the protest in the first place was the loss of faith and confidence in the U.S. election system.  The true people behind this loss of confidence are those who deny an open forensic investigation of all mail-in ballots and vote-counting computers.

Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark nearly convinced then-President Donald Trump to remove then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and use the Department of Justice to undo Georgia's election results, The New York Times reported.
Clark -- who appealed to the former President's false claims of election fraud -- met with Trump earlier this month and told Rosen following the meeting that the then-President was going to replace him with Clark. Clark would then move to keep Congress from certifying the election results in then-President-elect Joe Biden's favor, according to the paper.
Rosen demanded to hear the news straight from Trump, according to the paper, and arranged a meeting on the evening of January 3 -- the same day that Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the state official to find enough votes for him to win Georgia, came to light.
During the meeting, Rosen, another top Justice Department official and Clark gathered with Trump, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other lawyers. Trump had Rosen and Clark state their cases for him, the Times reported. The Times cited two officials who compared Rosen's and Clark's opposing arguments during the meeting to an episode of ""The Apprentice,"" Trump's old reality TV show.
Citing four former Trump administration officials, the paper reported that an agreement among department leadership that they would all resign if Rosen were fired helped sway Trump from removing his acting attorney general. The notion of department pandemonium, congressional investigations and blowback from fellow Republicans seemed to resonate with Trump, who after nearly three hours decided to allow Rosen to stay and determined that Clark's plan would not work, according to the Times.
CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Clark told the Times that its report contained unspecified inaccuracies and that he could not speak to his conversations with Trump or department lawyers.

Thank you for your TA, some of the best on YT. 2020 was quite a year, and what is a better news for crypto than to see all-time highs at the years end? Both institutions and high-net-worth investors are starting to acknowledge Bitcoin as a store of value and as a treasury asset. Happy to be a partaker of such a change in the world of crypto, I know some hodlers are happy at the moment due to the recent rise, although you aren't supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts. That's why it was never second-guessing when an opportunity as crypto tradlng came my way. ""Why hold a currency you can multiply or grow?"" With much energy channeled into tradlng bitcoin daily with the guide of Lawrence, it was no surprise how my portfolio went from 3 Bitcoin to 19 Bitcoin within a year. I will always advlse anyone who just started dealing with Bitcoin or old holders, Trade people! It is truly easy, only requires your time. I registered with a Crypto mentor on Te.leqram mssngr who helped me grow my crypto portfoIio all the way to the top. @Lawrencesmithfx on Te.leqram 0R wh*ts*pp+14153260873 He truly made 2020 a blissful one, now looking forward to the new yeap

He's used other peoples money and lawyers who twisted the law. He is no business genius. His clearly being held accountable will unite the country. Doubts keep the division. He was a distraction in an already broken system. Subtract him. Clean his stain off.

It's times like these that reinforce my choice to register as Independent, and refuse to vote anyways. What's an election if one side can simply shut down the competition at our expense, and no matter who wins...we're confronted with ceaseless violence from the masses who can start riots out of just a disagreement. Former President Trump was far from an ideal leader. We haven't had one in nearly 50 or so years, he was however, outside the political status quo and I took some comfort in that. The sheer level of corruption that was exposed in recent time, that a political party; currently the Democratic party can wield is astonishing...but it doesn't matter now that the Democrats control nearly everything.

Clark is trying to protect himself by claiming he believes there was a fix or rigging of the election, so therefore he was receptive to Trump's overtures about inserting him as AG for the purpose of trying to invalidate Biden's win. So, perhaps Mr. Clark will explain what evidence he collected that made him believe Trump's assertions were correct.

4842,"Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark nearly convinced then-President Donald Trump to remove then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and use the Department of Justice to undo Georgia's election results, The New York Times reported.
Clark -- who appealed to the former President's false claims of election fraud -- met with Trump earlier this month and told Rosen following the meeting that the then-President was going to replace him with Clark. Clark would then move to keep Congress from certifying the election results in then-President-elect Joe Biden's favor, according to the paper.
Rosen demanded to hear the news straight from Trump, according to the paper, and arranged a meeting on the evening of January 3 -- the same day that Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the state official to find enough votes for him to win Georgia, came to light.
During the meeting, Rosen, another top Justice Department official and Clark gathered with Trump, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other lawyers. Trump had Rosen and Clark state their cases for him, the Times reported. The Times cited two officials who compared Rosen's and Clark's opposing arguments during the meeting to an episode of ""The Apprentice,"" Trump's old reality TV show.
Citing four former Trump administration officials, the paper reported that an agreement among department leadership that they would all resign if Rosen were fired helped sway Trump from removing his acting attorney general. The notion of department pandemonium, congressional investigations and blowback from fellow Republicans seemed to resonate with Trump, who after nearly three hours decided to allow Rosen to stay and determined that Clark's plan would not work, according to the Times.
CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Clark told the Times that its report contained unspecified inaccuracies and that he could not speak to his conversations with Trump or department lawyers.",news

Been following you for about 3 years and really trying to learn as much as I can. You're a real inspiration and your approach to personal finance has helped me achieve a lot. I've just gotten approved by the bank to buy a 350.000$ apartment with a 20% down payment at the age of 19, and I'm so excited to start my real estate journey. Hope to become as successful as you one day! Merry Christmas

Elon Musk's emergence as world richest man should be a  motivation to people on YouTube that are starting out that anything is possible. You will need to take major risks and invest TIME into whatever you may wanna do.  Good luck to everyone trying to get ahead in life, wish you guys nothing but the best.

Just imagine if you had invested more about the same time Elon Musk invested in stock, probably he might have still been the richest man in the world today,but do you know how much could be made by you equally? That's why i am still of the opinion that investing remains one of best ways to be financially big.
