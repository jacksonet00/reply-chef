I learned how to properly do my winged eyeliner because of you. I learned a lot from you when it comes to make up. And I’m so happy that you have 2.79M subscribers now compared to the last time I visited your channel. You deserve all the love and million subs! I love you so much! I’m so happy to watch your videos again you’re getting better at it everytime 😘❤️ I hope God will bless you more because you have a good and strong heart 💖💖💖💗💗💗

I am sincerely thankful that you decided to do video tutorials, my anxiety and my make up skills thank you from the bottom of their heart. Your voice is so calming that I could watch you even if I don’t want to learn anything about make up, ( but I do).. so I have a question .. what is the brand of the sponge you use, I feel like the ones I have don’t work or I’m doing something wrong, they are a less than $5 brand that I can’t even remember.. I hope you read this and thanks so much for sharing your tips with us! 😍

Mainly the primer step and eyeshadow steps. Seems so simple and easy! Thank you! :) Also, do you have recommendations on brushes? Like, what all is needed? Suggestion: maybe add the link to the brushes you have :)

She's not wrong about the water thing... I started drinking way more water and completely dropped soda and by roughly the fourth or fifth day I noticed my skin was smoother-looking, less red and seemed to be producing a much more normal amount of oil. (My skin is combination skin, and this was with my bad consistency with a skincare routine lol)

I've tried several drugstore eyeshadow primers, they're okay. Essence I 🤍 Stage is good enough, though I feel that it's no different from using a concealer. This is also why I haven't tried MAC paint pot 😅 HOWEVER, I do like using Maybelline Fit Me powder (compact) on my lids; and I don't experience creasing, even on creamier eyeshadows.

2031,2031,966.0,966.0,False lashes for everyday? 😲
2032,2032,967.0,967.0,Unless you work in retail then ok yeah maybe you should put that extra time putting that much eye make up on. I’m in marketing working for corporate so I’m being paid to show up to work with my brain not my make up.
2033,2033,968.0,968.0,But you already did your brows so its not consider as 5mins
2034,2034,969.0,969.0,5 minutes fake video.... it will take atleast 20-30 mins.
2035,2035,970.0,970.0,So 5 minutes left eye plus 5 minutes right eye is a total 10 minutes for the eyes aannnd of course if you can do a straight  line with the eyeliner and then the struggle with the fake lashes so let just say 30-40 minutes? 😂
2036,2036,971.0,971.0,and finally its alll about the fake lashes that i cannot tk care of
2037,2037,972.0,972.0,Fake lashes every day for work???😒Nope thanks🖓
2038,2038,973.0,973.0,Do you think 5mins is sufficient to do this? Let's not put false info on thumbnail.. moreover this makeup should be for party not for office..
2039,2039,974.0,974.0,Very pretty. The eyeshadow was beautiful but I dnk anyone that wears false lashes to work and school.  I do not feel that they are appropriate either place. In fact I have seen false lashes added to employee handbooks as something not appropriate to wear to work. Maybe consider that next time.
2040,2040,975.0,975.0,Falda lashes for daily make up... sorry but what shall we use for night2😏😏😏

The darkness around your eyes is amazing. Makeup artists usually dont cover that up if they can when it's so beautifully compliments the face. Theyll put the concealer close to the eye but leave the darkness right below the eye bc it just looks so nice.

Her routine is pretty intense but in the long run, you need to have a strong disciplined skillset like hers to keep looking fresh and maintain a great appearance. She didn't look horrible without makeup in the first place and with it on, she looks refreshed. I love to see it and definitely will be picking up some of these high end products and ingraining them into my routine.

1,1,,,"From Vitamin C serum to a lip scrub and lash primer, Madelaine Petsch has mastered an all-encompassing beauty regimen.

Filmed at The Bowery Hotel

Still haven’t subscribed to Vogue on YouTube? ►► "
2,2,,,If Madelaine needs 38 beauty steps I’m not sure how many I need
3,3,,,"Does anyone else act like they are making these kind of videos, when they are getting ready"
4,4,,,how tf does she remember all of that?
5,5,,,how ironic that her lip balm is called ‘cherry bomb’
6,6,,,why is no one talking about her BEAUTIFUL long eyelashes???
7,7,,,"Hey Vogue, start listing the products in your description box."
8,8,,,"Her: “never EVER drag on your eye”
Me: aggressively rubs on eyes at least 10 times a day"
9,9,,,"Madelaine: 38 steps
Me: oh, I just... use water"
10,10,,,"""I get dark circles when I travel"" sis I dont see any dark circles"
11,11,,,Tbh Madeline doesn’t even need makeup she’s literally so pretty
12,12,,,She has already won me over by tying up her hair. I can’t believe the amount of people that do skincare or makeup with their hair in their face!
13,13,,,"Her: my hair loves oil
Me: my hair loves oil so much it produces quite a lot of it’s own"
14,14,,,"Madelaine: My hair speaks to me.

Cheryl: Jason talks to me."
15,15,,,can we just talk about how cute her nails are !!
16,16,,,"Me trying to copy madelaines routine
1. Lights the candle"
17,17,,,"Has a really mean, bitchy role, but one of the nicest actresses ever."
18,18,,,"Madelaine: Has on no mascara at the beginning and still has gorgeous long luscious lashes
Me: Puts on 30 pounds of mascara, still looks like Voldemort"
19,19,,,Everyone needs a best friend or a sister like Madelaine. She just seems like the sweetest and funniest person
20,20,,,I don’t know why but like her lips are beautiful 😌
21,21,,,"Mads: ""I'm 25""
Me: Gurl, you look like 19"
22,22,,,"sis, if i had the salary she did, i'd have a 38-step beauty routine too."
23,23,,,"Her routine is pretty intense but in the long run, you need to have a strong disciplined skillset like hers to keep looking fresh and maintain a great appearance. She didn't look horrible without makeup in the first place and with it on, she looks refreshed. I love to see it and definitely will be picking up some of these high end products and ingraining them into my routine."
24,24,,,when she said “let’s get to makeup” she sounded just how she sounds on the show😂
25,25,,,No my hair dosen´t speak to me. I think it died when I bleached it.
26,26,,,I love how she’s just so used to talking to cameras like she’s an actress and you tuber
27,27,,,she just seems like she really has her life together.
28,28,,,"To anyone who’s wondering what products she’s using, on the vogue website for madelaines routine it has the products at the bottom of the page. Hope this helps"

Gurl you legit just out ICE on your face"

33,33,,,I would have never guessed she’s South African🤠
34,34,,,She looks like such a nice person I’d love to have her as a friend
35,35,,,I mean I thought she had makeup on. But that’s her natural skin. That’s so beautiful. Her glowing clean skin proves her skincare routine is amazing and it actually works.
36,36,,,So beautiful and her lashes and everything wow the pretties ginger
37,37,,,she literally has the nicest skin I've ever seen.
38,38,,,Tbh she literally looks like one of those porcelain glass dolls. She's the most down to earth actress and so REAL.❤️
39,39,,,"Kj and Cole sipping beer when taking a break, Kwvin and Ashley listening to music, Camila and Charles goofing around

Well Madelaine and Lili are extracting each others blackheads.."
40,40,,,can we talk about how pretty she is with literally no makeup
41,41,,,what was she concealing?? she has perfect skin. literally.

58,58,,,"You can literally see she enjoying that and she doesn’t only do it to look pretty, but also to feel pretty. and she just likes taking care of herself.

i love her sm"
59,59,,,"Did anybody else think that she sounded like Voldemort when she said ""Yes, yes. Put some more""?"

65,65,,,Shes so pretty without  makeup and her eyelashes are sooo  long and i love how she doesnt wear a lot of makeup. she uses cc cream instead of foundation and cc cream is literaly tinted moisturizer. I lover her routine
66,66,,,"*cries in ugly forehead breakout*

67,67,,,The whole time I smiled cause of her beautiful smile 😊🌼
68,68,,,She has such a great skin and long eyelashes. I'm so jealous....

70,70,,,Where can we get a list of the products she used? @Vogue can you list it in the description box?
71,71,,,Watching women and their skin care routines makes me feel like a bridge troll
72,72,,,And i never knew there is eyelash primer thing also😫
73,73,,,"I’m a natural red head, but I’m half Asian so I wanted to look more “Asian” so I dyed it brown and I regret it so much. Now I have a naturally red face and freckles, and brown hair"
74,74,,,"“i get dark circles when i travel”

87,87,,,"""NEVER FORGET THE NECK"" me: Hahahah 😂🤣"
88,88,,,"Putting oil on the skin in the daytime could give sun spots, as I've heard. Putting it on in the night is better, but rinse it all off before going in the sun"
