When you were worried about applying the lighter brown under your eye, I immediately thought of Wayne Goss' brush number 08 and 07! If you don't already have them, get them!

I learned how to properly do my winged eyeliner because of you. I learned a lot from you when it comes to make up. And I’m so happy that you have 2.79M subscribers now compared to the last time I visited your channel. You deserve all the love and million subs! I love you so much! I’m so happy to watch your videos again you’re getting better at it everytime 😘❤️ I hope God will bless you more because you have a good and strong heart 💖💖💖💗💗💗

I’m so happy to watch your videos again you’re getting better at it everytime 😘❤️ I hope God will bless you more because you have a good and strong heart 💖💖💖💗💗💗

360,360,I was really enjoying a video and I thought that you had some really good tips but I feel that you went way too fast you barely showed what you used what colors you used how you did what you did and you barely showed anything and then you were done so yes very disappointed would have loved to see more of what you did and how you did it
361,361,Is that your real voice its so cute

I am sincerely thankful that you decided to do video tutorials, my anxiety and my make up skills thank you from the bottom of their heart. Your voice is so calming that I could watch you even if I don’t want to learn anything about make up, ( but I do).. so I have a question .. what is the brand of the sponge you use, I feel like the ones I have don’t work or I’m doing something wrong, they are a less than $5 brand that I can’t even remember.. I hope you read this and thanks so much for sharing your tips with us! 😍

She's not wrong about the water thing... I started drinking way more water and completely dropped soda and by roughly the fourth or fifth day I noticed my skin was smoother-looking, less red and seemed to be producing a much more normal amount of oil. (My skin is combination skin, and this was with my bad consistency with a skincare routine lol)

Your voice is so calming that I could watch you even if I don’t want to learn anything about make up, ( but I do).. so I have a question .. what is the brand of the sponge you use, I feel like the ones I have don’t work or I’m doing something wrong, they are a less than $5 brand that I can’t even remember.. I hope you read this and thanks so much for sharing your tips with us! 😍"

Thanks for this video. I’m new to makeup and my mom won’t help me. So I’ve been trying for 3 years to learn by myself. This helps my eyeshadow routine in the morning take 10 minutes instead of 30 minutes..again trying to learn 😅 Especially the mascara tip. Not as much mascara getting in my eyelids so BIG THANKS! ❤️🙂

Now looking at this video; eyeshadow guards, smudging eyeliner, fake lashes and already finished skin and eyebrow makeup, i am having a good laugh. No person can do that. I mean not even the girl in the video.

Surely its 10 minute eye make up? as it takes 5 mins to do one eye? Then how long did it take her to layer on the base and contouring?  It looks lovely, but certainly not a 5 min look.

I've tried several drugstore eyeshadow primers, they're okay. Essence I 🤍 Stage is good enough, though I feel that it's no different from using a concealer. This is also why I haven't tried MAC paint pot 😅 HOWEVER, I do like using Maybelline Fit Me powder (compact) on my lids; and I don't experience creasing, even on creamier eyeshadows.

So simple and great for beginners learning how to do eye shadow! But also great for people who are on the go wanting to do a quick cute eye look. 

Btw I love that little detail you do with the darker shimmer color right on and above the liner then smudging it. Beautiful ❤️

2,2,"Whenever someone else does eyeshadow, it looks great. When I try to do eyeshadow, it looks like I got punched in the eye"
3,3,"No offence that was so bomb , but her everyday eye makeup is my wedding makeup goal  💁"
4,4,Fake lashes will make this eye 5 minutes to 5 hours.
5,5,If I did this for school my school principle just kick me out of the school 😂 and says that it's not a fashion week pramp
6,6,lets not be fooled. this took more than just 5 minutes.
7,7,"This 5 minute for one eye.
We need half hour further to balance the eyes..."
8,8,I can't even put eyeliner. Oh who am I kidding I can't even put lipstick. And I'm old in my late 20s
9,9,"I think you forgot to put a ""0"" after the 5.😃"
10,10,5 minutes not enough for me for this make-up. I need minimum 30 minutes
11,11,I’m middle aged and I find that when I do my lower lashes and lower eyeliner like this it makes me look older and like a panda 🐼
12,12,This is gorgeous but 5 minutes is just for one eye... For both of the eyes and the whole makeup generally we need around 30 minutes.
13,13,I dont think this is 5 minutes eye makeup for me especially when the eyeliner and fake lashes part started.
14,14,It’s so freaking perfect!!! When I try to do a fancy eyeshadow it ends up looking like a 3 year old got into some markers and colored on my eyes 👀
15,15,Amazing makeup look. But defo not 5 min or for school/work. For me it's an hour glam!! 😍😍👏🏼👏🏼
16,16,"Definitely a drugstore look ❤️ I use the Maybelline Fit Me Concealer to prime my eyes. I love it, doesn't crease/settle into wrinkles"
17,17,I wish if I can do my eye makeup with this much perfection 😭
18,18,Nyx eye primer is really good. They have one the same color as the Mac one you used and I love it. The pearl white is also good for shimmer colors. Great video. Thank you 🥰
19,19,I immediatly thought you would live in the Nederlands ;) The accent always stays I guess. Nice tutorial!
20,20,Five minutes... HÁ!!!!
21,21,"If this is her everyday eye makeup,
What will be her party makeup😍😍🤐"
22,22,It’s so freaking perfect!!! When I try to do a fancy eyeshadow it ends up looking like a 3 year old got into some markers and colored on my eyes :)
23,23,"I'm going to use this for my univ graduation, exactly what I was looking for, something simple, elegant but that actually looks like a try a little lmao"
24,24,I really love her eyebrows
25,25,I live on affordability.  I’m a beauty on a budget .  This is beautiful.
26,26,This is So Amazing Keep it up ~!
27,27,This look is actually easy (without the lashes) thanks!
28,28,"My recommendation for a drugstore eyeshadow primer would be the Nyx Jumbo Pencil(Shade Milk), it works like a charm"
29,29,If i had eyebrows as perfect as yours then i wouldn't even bother to put on any eye makeup😂
30,30,0:00 when she blinked in time with the music 😻
31,31,The way she says color is everything 😂😂😂❤️
32,32,I am totally living for this look! I would wear it with a nice bold red lipstick and boom!
33,33,"Why am I even watching this the only ""eyeshadow"" I have is my contour palette😂"
34,34,Tried this makeup look with similar colors today & loved it! 😊 New viewer here 🙋🏻‍♀️
35,35,Now Imagine acctually wearing this make up everyday to school .
36,36,I did my eyebrows a bit perfect now
37,37,I really hope to do makeup like this one day. God it's beautiful
38,38,Hey Everyone! 😍 Shall I film a full face of drugstore makeup this week?!! Let me know ❤️❤️
39,39,I really enjoyed this tutorial.. thank you
40,40,Very pretty! <3
41,41,It’s hard to buy eyeshadow guard ㅜㅜ but this makeup look is so beautiful 😍 as always 감사합니다!
42,42,"Love this look and that essence pallette , elegant!"
43,43,"Yes, to drugstore!!! Want to see more tutorials"
44,44,"⚠️ That’s not gonna take 5 mins in real life...

For starters you have two eyes so that’s an extra 5 min. "
45,45,it is so freaking perfect. i love this trick. best part of this video is when she work on eyelashes it looks gorgeous
46,46,Her 5 minutes can be 50 minutes to me..I'd rather go to work with my panda eyes as a make up..😅
47,47,"Amazing 👏👏👏👏👍👍
Now I go to school everyday and do the same makeup😊"
48,48,So pretty!! I'd love to see what your drug store faves/go-to items are🤩

162,162,"5 minutes for the left eye, and another 5 minutes for the right eye"
163,163,Actually it's a party eyemakeup for me:3
164,164,It will take 5 mins for me just to do the eyeliner 🙃
165,165,That is so pretty oh my god. Definitely thinking of buying that palette to play with
166,166,The smudging part is where everything will go wrong for me🙄🤦‍♀️
167,167,"Yes, use some drugstore products like L'OREAL or Milani, but whatever you do will be fine also love your look"
168,168,"I try eye makeup, then I don't feel confident enough, remove it and go out. But just putting it on and taking it off gives me relaxation sometimes 🤣"

890,890,I love the Milani eyeshadow primer....I don't even set it.  And then if you haven't tried Tarte Big Ego mascara.... you should try it.  It truly curls my lashes and gives such volume and length.... looks like I'm wearing falsies!
891,891,"1) I'm sure it took way more than 5 minutes...
2) I personally don't think this make up is good for school, at least I would not wear this at school... 🤷🏻‍♀️"

923,923,Worst 5 mint
924,924,Lets not fall for this it is 5 min but that's one eye only so 5+5=10 so this will take 10 min
925,925,Rubbish
926,926,"Just a genuine question, but will people really take me seriously if I wear eye makeup to work? I understand if we're doing the rest of the face, but I usually skip eye makeup because I often feel like it's not appropriate for the work environment (minus the eyeliner)."
927,927,Well this kind of make up is not allowed in Indian school.
928,928,Que Dios nos perdone.
929,929,Is this necessary that we should apply fake lashes every single day.....
930,930,I think we go to different kind of schools 😬
931,931,School! Are you sure 😶
932,932,"Beautifull makeup but it’s too intense for a day, escpacially for work or school in my opinion."
933,933,Lol... who go to school with such eye makeup?? 😂
934,934,Is it obligatory to do make-up for school??
935,935,What? Lashes For school? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
936,936,And trust me guys u wont like ur eyes anymore if u put faks eyelashes even for events
937,937,Its beautiful but too much for me.
938,938,"This makeup look neither suitable for daily look nor school, but it was awesome"
939,939,"It's not a daily use makeup and please don't upload fake 5mins video, it I'll be take at least 1hr🤔"
940,940,YOU DONT NEED MAKEUP FOR SCHOOL OMG
941,941,What ? this is school makeup
942,942,people will lose their eyes if they do this each day !
943,943,"JESUS CHRIST IS LOAD FOREVERMORE, PLEASE LET US SURRENDER TOTALLY TO JESUS CHRIST, REPENT AND LOVE JESUS. GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS US ALL IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME AMEN"
944,944,Nice ...but m nt going to using mac cosmetic on every day basis..🙄
945,945,But you did one eye in 5 min not two😁😅😂
946,946,Why was this video recommended? And why does this have so many views?
947,947,"Everything is fine ,but my question is who will do this before going to school?"
948,948,The thing is she already had her brows done and for only the brows I have 15mins of work to do
949,949,It looks awesome but it’s not at all simple
950,950,I'm confused... It took 5 mins for one eye... How is that a 5min make up??
951,951,"Looks beautiful, no question. But for work or even school? That's too much. 😐 
But still looks very nice and soft.
Greetings from my channel 🙂✨"
952,952,What?? Everyday make up wearing fake lashes? 🤷
953,953,Are you seriois this makeup 4 school.. 🙄
954,954,No this make up for school....
955,955,This is really not work appropriate?
956,956,I would like to know who wears shimmery pink shadow to school. Or work. Or as an everyday colour option.
957,957,Do u wear everyday eyelashes? Who goes to work with eyelashes
958,958,Way to long thooo
959,959,For school and all who will put this much makeup
960,960,Neither office nor school allow this makeup!!
961,961,So funny it not a school aur office makeup😂😂
962,962,This is not an everyday make up look..
963,963,Yes why not? School and office is for fashion show.
964,964,The make up is classy but to make up like this for school everyday is totally absurd
965,965,She not show if she go to school/work and everyday
966,966,False lashes for everyday? 😲
967,967,Unless you work in retail then ok yeah maybe you should put that extra time putting that much eye make up on. I’m in marketing working for corporate so I’m being paid to show up to work with my brain not my make up.
968,968,But you already did your brows so its not consider as 5mins
969,969,5 minutes fake video.... it will take atleast 20-30 mins.
970,970,So 5 minutes left eye plus 5 minutes right eye is a total 10 minutes for the eyes aannnd of course if you can do a straight  line with the eyeliner and then the struggle with the fake lashes so let just say 30-40 minutes? 😂
971,971,and finally its alll about the fake lashes that i cannot tk care of
972,972,Fake lashes every day for work???😒Nope thanks🖓
973,973,Do you think 5mins is sufficient to do this? Let's not put false info on thumbnail.. moreover this makeup should be for party not for office..
974,974,Very pretty. The eyeshadow was beautiful but I dnk anyone that wears false lashes to work and school.  I do not feel that they are appropriate either place. In fact I have seen false lashes added to employee handbooks as something not appropriate to wear to work. Maybe consider that next time.
975,975,Falda lashes for daily make up... sorry but what shall we use for night2😏😏😏
976,976,Bad
977,977,It is impossible to do this makeup in 5 minutes !! 👎
978,978,For school????? Only if you are the teacher....
979,979,"Usually my everyday makeup

1. Moisturiser lotion
2. Face powder"
980,980,that's too much make up to be doing it lately👎🥴
981,981,worst excuse ever.
982,982,This is not 5mins
983,983,Your lower lashes are horrible 🤣
984,984,This is waaayy too much for school. Are you going to school to learn something or to show your self 🤨🤨
985,985,"5 minutes is a lot,i spend 1 minute"
986,986,"In what world is this a 5 minute everyday tutorial
 like, this would make me 3 hours late for work 😅"
987,987,Vapid and boring.
988,988,Fake eyeleshes wasent nnecessary in the eye tbh mascasa was more then enough
989,989,I don't understand why do people do makeup when they go to school ???? I mean they go to study not to show there makeup full of face😶😶 no offence okey please don't take it seriously.....
990,990,"Sorry, but if I see someone in my office or in school wearing this kind of makueup i’ll definitely assume they’re in a wrong place/event. This is not an everyday look, more of formal event. And i’m pretty sure not a 5 minute work."
991,991,"Beautiful...
BTW this makeup is not appropriate for school!"
992,992,Fake lashers 🤮👎🏼
