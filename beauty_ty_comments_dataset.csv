When you were worried about applying the lighter brown under your eye, I immediately thought of Wayne Goss' brush number 08 and 07! If you don't already have them, get them!

I learned how to properly do my winged eyeliner because of you. I learned a lot from you when it comes to make up. And I’m so happy that you have 2.79M subscribers now compared to the last time I visited your channel. You deserve all the love and million subs! I love you so much! I’m so happy to watch your videos again you’re getting better at it everytime 😘❤️ I hope God will bless you more because you have a good and strong heart 💖💖💖💗💗💗

I am sincerely thankful that you decided to do video tutorials, my anxiety and my make up skills thank you from the bottom of their heart. Your voice is so calming that I could watch you even if I don’t want to learn anything about make up, ( but I do).. so I have a question .. what is the brand of the sponge you use, I feel like the ones I have don’t work or I’m doing something wrong, they are a less than $5 brand that I can’t even remember.. I hope you read this and thanks so much for sharing your tips with us! 😍

She's not wrong about the water thing... I started drinking way more water and completely dropped soda and by roughly the fourth or fifth day I noticed my skin was smoother-looking, less red and seemed to be producing a much more normal amount of oil. (My skin is combination skin, and this was with my bad consistency with a skincare routine lol)

Before work, i rush foundation, eye pencil, eye shadow (monocolor), mascara, lipstick and it takes 10 minutes at least.  Now looking at this video; eyeshadow guards, smudging eyeliner, fake lashes and already finished skin and eyebrow makeup, i am having a good laugh. No person can do that. I mean not even the girl in the video.

I've tried several drugstore eyeshadow primers, they're okay. Essence I 🤍 Stage is good enough, though I feel that it's no different from using a concealer. This is also why I haven't tried MAC paint pot 😅 HOWEVER, I do like using Maybelline Fit Me powder (compact) on my lids; and I don't experience creasing, even on creamier eyeshadows.

The darkness around your eyes is amazing. Makeup artists usually dont cover that up if they can when it's so beautifully compliments the face. Theyll put the concealer close to the eye but leave the darkness right below the eye bc it just looks so nice.

2112,"I thought you were already wearing makeup at the beginning and I was like: 'Oh this is a really good makeup look, but I'll never look as good as her.'
And then I realised you didn't even have makeup on yet...",beauty
2113,She’s so pretty I can’t,beauty
2114,"omg you remind me of a young kendall jenner, even your voice 😍",beauty
2115,I though she had STARTED with makeup on 😂,beauty

2146,"Hi, your hair looks lovely!",beauty
2147,Oh my god... I literally never thought to curl my lashes. This may be an actual game changer tbh,beauty
2148,The darkness around your eyes is amazing. Makeup artists usually dont cover that up if they can when it's so beautifully compliments the face. Theyll put the concealer close to the eye but leave the darkness right below the eye bc it just looks so nice.,beauty
2149,"You're so, naturally, gorgeous. It kills me. Ilysm. ♡♡♡",beauty
2150,Your voice is so satisfying with headphones 🤤😍😭😂,beauty

2159,"I love wearing the ""no makeup, makeup look"". I've never been a fan of heavy makeup. I will wear more for special occasions, but stick mainly to the bare minimum.",beauty
2160,Love the hair and love the natural make up look.,beauty
2161,Finally a simple natural makeup tutorial. Tired of the super heavy foundation concealer tutorials and people calling it natural looking lol,beauty
2162,"O MY GOD she is so beautiful😍the darker color hair, Love it💕",beauty
2163,You're so beautiful babe!!,beauty

Her routine is pretty intense but in the long run, you need to have a strong disciplined skillset like hers to keep looking fresh and maintain a great appearance. She didn't look horrible without makeup in the first place and with it on, she looks refreshed. I love to see it and definitely will be picking up some of these high end products and ingraining them into my routine.
