Been following you for about 3 years and really trying to learn as much as I can. You're a real inspiration and your approach to personal finance has helped me achieve a lot. I've just gotten approved by the bank to buy a 350.000$ apartment with a 20% down payment at the age of 19, and I'm so excited to start my real estate journey. Hope to become as successful as you one day! Merry Christmas

Elon Musk's emergence as world richest man should be a  motivation to people on YouTube that are starting out that anything is possible. You will need to take major risks and invest TIME into whatever you may wanna do.  Good luck to everyone trying to get ahead in life, wish you guys nothing but the best.

Just imagine if you had invested more about the same time Elon Musk invested in stock, probably he might have still been the richest man in the world today,but do you know how much could be made by you equally? That's why i am still of the opinion that investing remains one of best ways to be financially big.

Hope to become as successful as you one day! Merry Christmas"
