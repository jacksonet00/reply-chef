1,"Here is what’s happening in the stock market today, how to invest moving forward, and everything else you need to know to build wealth and retire early. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan

LIMITED TIME: Get A FREE $8+ STOCK ON WEBULL when you deposit $100 (Potentially Worth up to $1600): "
2,"When is Mr. wonderful Kevin video coming out?!!
Congrats on all the success man!"
3,"""suspicious activity reports (sars) ........ fitting for 2020."
4,They closed casinos and options are the next best thing
5,the only disadvantage of watching Graham is all the 'get rich quick' scam ads......
6,"Great explanation! Never knew what an option was before, obviously not spending enough time in /r/wallstreetbets. I wonder though, while amateur investors using the market to gamble sounds like a recipe for disaster, fundamentally shouldn't the ability to use leverage while investing in the stock market be just as useful as using leverage to invest in real estate? Could there be some safer way to use options on an index fund? Or would those options be more expensive since the investment is less risky?"
7,I’m a simple man. I watch my portfolio fall and come to graham to be reminded that it’s all okay
8,"Nice video 👌 Graham Stephan
Despite all the economic crisis this is the best time to start up an investment"
9,"The rich see economic crisis as a garage sale, that’s why investing right now will be the best decision..."
10,“What’s up Graham it’s guys you here” it was hard to focus on the vid after that intro LOLLL
11,"""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."" I like that one."
12,when you don't even realize the stock market is crashing bc you've been losing money for weeks
13,"""What's up Graham it's guys you here""
-GRAHAM STEPHEN,2020"
14,"Retail investing in 2020: ""They mistook leverage for genius."" -- Steve Eisman"
15,Graham is like that friend trying to reassure me everything is okay. I’m okay 🙃
16,Commenting a couple days late so the YouTube algorithm realizes this video is still relevant!
17,“StOnKs OnLy Go Up”
18,Wallstreetbets has entered the chat
19,I'm a long term click and hold investor of Graham's Like button
20,Everything about to be on sale 😎
21,NKLA BagHolder has left the chat
22,"""what's up graham it's guys you here"" killed me"
23,“What’s up Grahams? Guys here?”. I’m paying attention! Lol.
24,Graham Stephen was the kinda kid that held the crayon in his whole hand
25,The beginning lowkey had me thinking my earbuds we're whack
26,Robinhood investors have to go back to school!😂🤣😂🤣😂
27,"No one:

Me during the first line: 👁👄👁"
28,i like how your version of crash is a 2% down on a full month...
29,"""What's up Graham it's guys you here"" 

First spending money now this"
30,I love it when he says “what’s up Graham’s”
31,"""What's up, Grahame!"" Hey."
32,Your intros are sometimes funny; like you’re testing who’s actually listening what you’re saying!  I have dyslexic moments myself too sometimes.
33,“What’s up Graham it’s guys you here.” 😂😂
34,I'm over here waiting on the housing bubble to burst
35,"""The Robinhood investors had to go back to school"". 🤣🤣😂That made my morning"
36,Let’s dress up as a like button from all social medias
37,"Not enough appreciation for that intro, almost got me"
38,Last time i was this early corona was just a drink
39,"I just love it when he uses that slow motion angry voice. Cracks me up every time, lol."
40,imagine new viewers when they saw the intro
41,The facial expressions in these thumbnails are hilarious
42,Imagine making the like button a stock
43,Waldemart comes slithering in.
44,"“What’s up Graham, it’s guys you here.” 🤪"
45,"""worst september in 10 years"" damn."
46,Graham getting into options around the same time I am truly is a blessing in disguise.
47,"Haha, I appreciate that you always make liking the video entertaining!"
48,Workhorse and Fiverr have been my saving grace🙏🏽
49,Just smashed the like button while the broken glass sound happened. Perfect sync.
50,Probably the best smash the like button advertisement I've heard to date. You've earned a sub.
51,"Like I keep saying, the market dropped because I bought! 🤦🏼‍♂️😁"
52,That intro had me questioning if I really was Graham.
53,"Buy in the dip, keep crashing and yell “long!”"
54,"Alessio Rastani would say:  ""
Show Me The Charts and I'll Tell You the News"""
55,"Did you just say...""what's up Graham, it's guys you here"" ?? Or am I having a stroke 🤔"
56,"""The answer to debt is more debt"" - The Gov't, probably, or maybe Robinhood margin yolo-ers"
57,"SoftBank: Buys $4,000,000,000 in call options

Everyone: Damn RH traders flooding the market..."
58,i swear i just had seizure in the first 10 seconds
59,I just seen the social dilemma on Netflix  and now I know who created the like button lol I also get your videos recommended to me 😁
60,"He said 'What's up Graham, it's Guys you here' !! :D"
61,Had to play the start back like 5 times to understand what just happened
62,you really have too start deleting all the comments made from these bots
63,"Is it sad that after watching hundreds of Graham's videos, this is literally the first time he didn't catch me off guard with the smashing-the-like-button joke?"
64,"Update: From Thursday 24th September, bars, pubs and restaurants will be closed from 10pm in the UK"
65,"Little Jimmy can't trade options anymore, since he is busy with his 5th grade maths now haha! Thanks for the share!"
66,"omg Again, ""what's up Graham, it's guys here"" hahahaha loved it"
67,"""What's up Graham it's guys you here"" 😆 I just love when you put those in your video 🙂"
68,"I'm stuck on, 'what's up Graham it's guys you here'. Made my day! lol Great video as always :)"
69,This was very helpful in understanding what’s happening. More videos like this please!
70,when is that like button going to spit out those dividends? when it goes public? graham we need answers! Lol
71,The Markets are so unpredictable some people panic some people take advantage of it
72,"October is a 3 paycheck month for me. So as long as the market keeps dropping, then I can keep buying in at a discount! 😅

Also, happy last day of summer everyone. Autumn 2020 begins. Let’s finish this crazy year with more shenanigans!"
73,Man at 7:26 I was so focused on he was explaining the option trading and then boom “mimicking Graham” then boom I start dying of laughter 🤣🤣😂
74,Your constant Like Button puns are great. lol
75,"Hi Guys, I'm Graham. So sad to see that the drop market just stocked..."
76,The irony of getting a Nespresso add on Graham’s video
77,Had to replay first 3 seconds of vid because i smelt something burning and Graham greeted himself as you guys
78,We all knew this was coming 🤦‍♀️
79,Delayed stimulus? But Meet Kevin keeps telling us 2-4 times per day that we're getting one.
80,"My plan: 
Step 1: Buy stocks for cheap
Step 2: Forget I bought stocks and randomly remember after like 20yrs
Step 3: Sell off all stocks and hopefully have enough money to afford a 21 cent Iced coffee"
81,"Ddnt even realize I just watched 11 minutes,, felt like 2. Guess that means it was good"
82,Leveraged trades...that teen that took his life comes to mind.
83,Awesome video Graham! Always a huge inspiration to me as a small Youtuber 👍
84,8:45 It seems funny but it’s actually true lmao
85,"He's doing it on purpose at this point... he's said ""Hey Graham, it's guys here"" several other videos. Now... he's changing it up. ""Hey Graham, it's guys you here."""
86,"For anyone who is a buyer of stocks over the next 20 years, a dropping stock market is great news!!! You get to own the businesses that you love at discount prices. When the media tries to spin it as something to be afraid of, flip it around in your brain and celebrate :)"
87,The Like button line was slick.
88,"Bruh he GOT me... ""single best investment you can make in less than a second and the ticker is SMASH""

I've never been more GOT GETTIN THAN THAT"
89,The like button (ticker symbol GSX:LIKE) has been traded at all time high in the last couple of videos on the GSX (Graham Stock Exchange)
90,Leverage is the Weapon of Mass destruction
91,You’re absolutely right about Robinhood users going back to school. I and literally everyone I know here at college is investing
92,My brain just stopped on the first 4 seconds.
93,"I regret that I can only hit the ""like"" button once for this video."
94,As always great content that helps break down concepts! Thanks Graham!!
95,Dang Graham just roasted me on using Margin. Oof.
96,The comment predictions are so good

102,My portfolio is crying rn 😭😢
103,"Great video, Graham! Sort of side topic, but I'd be interested in seeing a video on Nikola, given all the shenanigans (that's right, shenanigans) they appear to have gotten themselves into lately."
104,ya boy just yolo’d half my portfolio on tesla calls expiring the 25th abt to experience a severe loss of tendies
105,"I'm unlucky because after experiencing what's going on, it is my fault for not being fully aware of this.

Don't end up like me guys."
106,Happy Battery Day Eve!  😎 🚘
107,What are your thoughts on this Nikola situation?

109,"TESLA, AMAZON AND NETFLIX THATS ALL U NEED 🏃🏽"
110,Talk to Andrei about Nikola 😹
111,"Laughed at the Black White part ""Why doesn't this matter I don't buy Options. Why Should I care at the 7:28 to 7:30  mark"
112,"You can tell Graham got a girlfriend, he seems more dressed up now for his videos or something, I dont know what it is but he looks different hahaha"
113,"graham the most epic crossover would be for you to meet ben shapiro and then critique his spending
he sounds like you but at 1.5% faster speed 10/10 would recommend"
114,I can't  believe people still don't smash the like button for the YouTube algorithm
115,"no one: 
Graham: whatsup Graham it's guys you  here!!"
116,Dude I just recognized you on the show selling sunset! 😱
117,These intros always kill me 😂
118,"""Dont try to time the market!!"" but maaaybe i can lol"
119,"If the stocks app isn’t in your front page on your phone, you aren’t a true Graham Stephan fan"
120,"You missed a button bro.. not the like button, of course"
121,"Dude totally random, but you should do a collab with Matt D’Avella!"

125,SPHD SPYD are for real looking very attractive at these levels.
126,I love watching black&white skeptic Graham LOL

141,Those gray-scale sections remind me of Doug Stanhope
142,Appreciate the the detailed video description! It really helps in digesting the video better. Thanks Graham :)
143,Random question. Do youtubers still feel weird when the listen to their on voice when it's recorded? Like every other person. I figured you've been making videos this long you're probably used to it already 😄
144,It's always going extremely up or extremely down! This is insane!
145,Awesome intro! 😂 you had me confused for a good couple seconds. Great advice regarding trading with leverage.
146,Market recovering today as Graham posted it last night haha

148,is just me or is grahams hair popping off today?

Would you say it’s not hot outside at 127.4 degrees?"
150,"Looks like I bought in right at the top 😂
Should I buy more now or do you think it’ll drop further?"
151,Yep. I live in London and they’ve announced the 10pm curfew on bars and restaurants. I’m confident there will be a small lockdown next month.
152,"Awesome intro, I missed it at first lmao."
153,"Ok, how many times did it take to get that intro?"
154,Going all in on ONEQ (NASDAQ)
155,New hair? Also great video as always!
156,"Graham, can you make a video detailing all about options and option trading?? You do such a good job explaining things on a level everyone can understand."
157,I just smashed the like button when I see him to so hard not to smile every time he asks us to smash the like button. lol
158,Who else did a double take at that intro
159,Just realized Gram is a bit older than me which means in 60 years he may stop making videos but then how will I get my news (provided I am still alive).
160,Just realized Gram is a bit older than me which means in 60 years he may stop making videos but then how will I get my news (provided I am still alive).
161,"You made me laugh with your surprise ""hit the like button"". I always do it, but this time it was well deserved"
162,"The movie Margin Call on Amazon prime ( 3 stars) with Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons and Demi Moore  kind of explain the concept of margin calls."
163,stonks only go up! 📈
164,Looking like a player from a romactic drama series.. looking good.
165,That like button insertion was beautiful
166,I literally heard the hey Graham it's you guys and it just automatically made me smash the like button 😂🤣🤣🤪
167,10pm curfue is in force for pubs in the uk

170,"Really appreciate the explain like im 5 moments, Graham. Great video!!"
171,"""At the time of this video the stock market has recovered it's losses and is on the way to new all time highs"""

173,Great time to join the stonk market
174,I love your Goofy intro. Makes me laugh every time. Have a good day! Thank you for the Info as always !
175,"Bro, I’m doing my homework right now so I can’t watch. I’ll come back later though. Love your videos Graham."
176,"You're right sir, Thanks for introducing me to Mr spencer"
177,"nice looking shirt man, 👍looks like someone about to head to the carribeans"
178,Am I the only one who noticed that Graham swapped words in his intro greeting? 🤣
179,"Dude, Stroke, why do I have a Graham every time start video does?"
180,"“What’s up Graham it’s guys you here.”

Me:🤔"
181,"What's up Graham, guys-you here."
