13,"Thumbnail: On the verge of tears ""what am I going to do?""
Video Graham: It's fineee"

39,"6:36 59 dollar profit*, still have to pay the premium ;)"
40,"Stocks are good but I swapped and invested in forex trading, I've been making good profit"
41,"“Green is good, red is bad!!!” 😂 😂 😂 “then no guys you’ve been making too much loses...” Oh Graham, always a bust as I learn ❤️❤️much love man!"

122,Just consistently invest in an index fund tracking the entire market and forget worrying about the ups and downs.
123,"I've made watching these videos part of my routine, even though I already know what Graham is going to say. Very grounding. I actually sold last week and bought back in this week, realizing a few grand of gain, even though that's the opposite of what Graham suggests. I was so glad tho, that I didn't forget the lessons, and bought back in this monday, tuesday and wednesday. Made it back in! Thanks, Graham, for giving me the confidence to dive right back in with full gusto."
124,Thank you. Excellent video!
125,It’s actually way more than $1 to lose when it’s below/above(depending on the call/put you have) on the option expiry day.

136,I texted my robinhood buddy today that I’m convinced SoftBank stole my money... perfect timing... 😅
137,I never thought i would see the day Graham would talk about options. Its too tempting NOT to read wallstreetbets  😂
138,This channel is an ABSOLUTE game changer for me. Thanks Graham
139,what's a good investing platform?
140,"It's now just a waste of time watching the same old stuff with a new twist! No new ideas or twists! Disappointed, much!"

142,That might have been the most misleading explanation of options...
143,thank you for explaining options
144,"Ready for the dead cat bounce, let's go!"

148,I love you ur videos! I started personal finance podcast for teens
149,I thought call options don't have an impact on the stock value before completion of transaction? Was this a lie?

151,Yep r/wallstreetsbet predicted this.
152,I sold something last month and I now have $2k for clearance/black Friday sale stock shopping. I'm ready for it!

154,"Heads up...I had to suffer thru about 6 ads watching this...I cut them all at ""skip ads""...the video is good though.."
155,just bought a ton of marriott stock this week.  once travel picks back up stock will recover nicely.
156,That was so brutal -10k :( Graham
157,I don't know who needs to hear this but stop saving money. Invest some of it if you want financial freedom
158,"Dammit, I hit like before the count down"
159,I bought the dip on Kodak.... but it just keeps dipping 😿
160,It seems like the video edited yesterday. But you were right and meaningful in many things . Market which is up today and will be down tomo
161,"It has to do with technical analysis pretty much, price reached the ceiling on rising parallel channel in a logarithmic chart."
162,"Also my theory is this: September is the worst month, also we are experiencing a pre-election uncertainty drop. After election, it's really going to go up, imho. Peace out"
163,I couldn’t like it the same time as the count down because it was already liked
164,"Bro, panic selling, blows my mind tbh. the price goes up every time a purchase is made, right? why are you not holding??"
165,Another great and insightful video! Really appreciate the time you take on all of these. 🙏

170,"You should make a discord group, would join 10/10"
171,Dude every time the stock market does a pullback you make a video. It’s a healthy pullback we needed it. Trust me in a month or so it will be higher. Then a pullback again and then a video from you
172,"by the time this came out, market kinda popped up, lol"
173,"That countdown worked! I smashed it, is it a boy or a girl coudn't see the explosion.."
174,Graham that orange tho: wear more bright colors 👍
175,Is $4B really that much for a bunch of tech stock options?
176,Bro im gonna laugh hecka hard when the market crashes and see how u backpeddle ur way out of what u said in this vid 🤣
177,"I really remember you saying, ""Buy and Hold"""
178,Do you think it'll affect the LCA and golden nugget merger?
179,it is so interesting how this will continue and what it will lead to 😮 i am going to wait for Graham to make another video when this all goes one way or another 😃 love this video!
180,"reads title
oh great another video where Graham puts 50k in the S&P"
181,Love the vids. I just started investing a couple months ago. Nothing major. Just a couple hundred to start. I’ve shifted some stocks but looks like it might be time to put a lil more in the kitty 👍.  ✌️❤️
182,are you gonna make separate video about the tesla stock split?
183,Graham is the only youtuber that can make a video of him literally farting and will get a 95% of the people smash the like button
184,"Collapse? Hell yeah, buy more"
185,Better than expected!! Hahaha
186,I destroyed the like button before Graham blew up! Great video as always!
187,Hey Graham recently started watching your videos. Got to thinking how often do you invest. Example. Make sure rainy day fund is filled then wait till have an extra 1k/5k/10k or as little as $100?  Hope this makes a little sense to you.
188,Wow just checked the price of Tesla. Maybe it could be part of my portfolio when it settles... Doesn't look like a fun stock now. ARK is selling Tesla and Crispr
189,Still above pre-COVID ath
190,Thanks Graham!  You should do a collaboration video with Ralliroots about a side hustle for everyone to check out!  That would be awesome!
191,Hey graham ! Can u reply for this message 🙏
192,"""But Graham, I'm in the green. You are so wrong, I'm not watching your videos anymore""....lol.....not true, keep up the good work!"
