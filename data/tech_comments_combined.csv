I give Clément Mihailescu a mock React.js interview that is geared towards beginners.\n\nCheckout the video we made on Clem's channel:,tech

Do you know what the scariest thing in the world is? Not knowing how to write a React component in a Ben Awad interview.,tech
so i work for him and he works for you...? i may have to quit,tech
How front end interviews should be: This video\n\nHow they actually are: ok so can you invert a binary tree for me please,tech
gender: “female”\nname: Object\n8:32,tech
I wish every tech interview was as friendly,tech
"""Feel free to use Google, StackOverflow..."" ""Real"" interviewers should take note!",tech
"imagine saying ""the uglier the better"" to a front end dev😂\nPs- Thanks for the 200 likes",tech
Ben is doing the sassy interviewer stereotype perfectly here.,tech
cool trick: \n1. Know nothing about React\n2. Watch this video\n3. Study React for a bit,tech
Clement when you did map - you forgot to assign key attribute.,tech
"22:00 - hmmm, did someone change the userInfo type in the userInfos.map call?",tech
I was dying with laughter when he tried to disable the lint rule with a comment,tech
Can we just appreciate and admire how Clement has nearly 100% accuracy while typing at those speeds,tech
"Ben, can you interview the Techlead? :D",tech
"This way of interviewing seems way more relative than just doing algorithms, I wish companies would adopt this.",tech
"""Uglier the better, this is my jam"" nailed it.",tech
12:26 we're not gonna catch any errors cuz..... we don't do that here\n\nCEO MATERIAL SPOTTED,tech
"Bruh, Imagine getting a job.",tech
"useCallback instead of useRef - it memoizes the fetch function for ref equality, so the effect doesnt rerun on every render. UseCallback will mean that if you eventually do a refactor so the function does depend on some value inside the component, your compiler will yell at you until you include it as a dependency. Useref might solve the problem now, but it can hide future potential dependencies. Also, working with a ref is annoying, constantly looking up .current or forgetting to.",tech
Should totally do the advanced react interview next,tech
tech youtubers have the best content on no nut november...\nhmmm...,tech
"Aside from needing to learn more about pagination, I’d get the job 😂 I wish interviews were like this",tech
"damn, even I'm nervous for Clement lmao",tech
This was inevitable. They are both great.,tech
"Just got to the gym, still in the parking lot .. can’t stop watching!! Haha great video",tech
33:05 - Wrap fetchNextUser with useCallback so the function reference will be memoized between component re-renders. It's a good and efficient practice and will satisfy the linter :),tech
Jajaja I've never imagined see those two in a vídeo jajaja,tech
i like the fact that clement is humble and admit that he doesn't know about the error upfront,tech
"""I'll put this in a p tag""\n""fantastic...!""",tech
Next time pls hire Mark Zuckerberg,tech
"WAIT!!!! Clement didn't promote AlgoExpert here, he ain't Clement 😂😂😂😂😂",tech
"Oh man, lucky FizzBuzz wasn't mentioned or there would have been virtual hands thrown",tech
Am I the only one to get Clement's algo expert ad with his girlfriend on Ben's videos lol,tech
This guy could probably speed run building startups,tech
ben go on webdevsimplified quiz show,tech
I've got notification of this video from both channels.,tech
This is the most forgiving interview I've seen LOL. Pls be everyone's interviewer Ben!,tech
Waiting for the next interview... Angular xD,tech
this was amazing. Loved that it was frontend ( I never get that in my life anymore),tech
"Another version for sure, this was one of my favorites!",tech
"Some react interview just ask you questions, and they take it from there.",tech
"In the 1st question Ben said '' I wanna see 0, then Increase to 2 and 3 , 4 , 5...'' That counter must skip the '1' am I right ? btw yo Google dm me :D",tech
"I'd love to see you guys continue this as a series, gradually increasing the difficulty!",tech
This is the greatest crossover of all time,tech
"I wish all interviews Front-End were like this. Relaxing, yet, extensive.",tech
"""You can use google, you can use stackoverflow."" <- Where does someone find this interviewer?",tech
"Hope you make React tutorial from scratch, I want to learn Rear since you developed that status it motivated me so much",tech
"Hello, how do i get to be interviewed. I would like to feature on a react interview.",tech
"JSON.stringify(data, null, 2) is my goto thing, when I debug. :D",tech
Until you're gonna make a Vue interview I can't validate either of you :))),tech
"If this is a beginner React interview, I need to practice more. lol",tech
"Lol, this is really good content. Keep it up guys! I had so much fun watching this.",tech
"Love to see both of you ""trolling"", lol",tech
I've been watching both of your channels a lot recently so I was very confused and excited when I saw the thumbnail!,tech
Yes we want 2nd part of this interview for sure.,tech
"this interview: ""Feel free to google stuff""\nactual interview: what is the syntax to pass object to string?",tech
Looking forward to see advance interview on react!,tech
This is pretty similar to a recent react interview I had. Nice video and convo :),tech

But your videos give me the impression that I haven't learned anything, because all the points you make are sort of obvious in isolation, while in reality, after watching them I find myself much better able to explain some of the concepts in simple, accurate terms. I hope more channels follow this pattern of excellent conceptual learning.",tech

"@3Blue1Brown - A quick suggestion: Red-green color deficiency is the most common form of colorblindness. When trying to represent information via a color spectrum, could you please choose colors other than red and green for this reason? Red and blue are good choices because they are distinguishable by both red-green color deficient people as well as blue-yellow color deficient people, which is the second-most common form of colorblindness. I was completely unable to tell which pixels have positive weights and which ones had negative weights in your example due to my colorblindness. Thanks, and keep up the fantastic videos :)",tech

"Most fascinating channel on YT, hands down.",tech
"Could someone help me with the following? If the matrix multiplication shown in the video represents the full transition of activations from one layer to the next, why is the for loop at 15:14 necessary? (Does it represent multiple pairs of layers?)",tech
"Nice little touch at the end, SMART!",tech
Your videos are great! Thanks for the simple explanation of a complicated topic!,tech
"I can´t belief how good and easy this video is! Well done, very helpful",tech

"The more you know, the more you know that you don't know.",tech
"Great video, Thank you!",tech
First 30 seconds of the video\nMy brain is already wandering off so deep,tech
"Great videos! Thanks you so much. I find the way you explain by visualisation incredibly useful and also as I see it in my head when I really understand something, but this really speeds up the process!\n Minute 14:39 the ""b"" vector, shouldn't it go from zero to ""k"" rather than ""n""?",tech
"Great explanation for the layman , Thank You",tech
"Great video, but maybe, I would recommend to look for the perceptron explanation before seeing this video :), even though, this video contains an amazing explanation.",tech
Sentdex brought me here ! \nSubscribed even before watching.. Amazing series man !,tech
The most intuitive channel on YouTube...,tech
"I believe there is a typo at 14:36 , the vector of biases should have length k (not n)",tech
I think I just damaged some of my neurons trying to understand this.,tech
"It´s a mistake . In this example, ""k"" would be ""15"". And ""n"" would be ""783""",tech
"you know how to watch this video?, After every few minutes pause this video go away for 2 mins come back and continue watching I don't know why but this helped me a lot",tech
this was shockingly similar to a projection matrix. didn't see that coming,tech

Anybody else sometimes feel the need to clap at the end of the video?\nSquishification is now added to my vocabulary.,tech
"Great video! However, the ReLU function doesn't squish the numbers into [0,1] like the sigmoid function. Is that not a problem?",tech
Has anyone else recognized this voice as the same voice from Khan Academy?,tech
"NO... Not now 3B1B, I have two deadlines due in 6 hours",tech
Thanks for the crystal clear explanation!,tech

Keep making more videos on this subject.",tech
"That exaggeration on ""is"" is indicating the vsauce style , I know it blue brown 😋♥️👀",tech
"@3Blue1Brown Thank you sooo much for your amazing channel. I have learnt a lot from you. A quick correction: At 14:38, the last row of the bias matrix should be bk instead of bn.",tech
vsauce did this with people didnt know it was that similar,tech
"Wow! I learned more in 4 minutes from you than I did from the udacity tensorflow course from google(they focus more on how to use their frameworks and not on learning the ""why""). thank you so much! This is helping me grasp the fundamentals!",tech
Great video! It would have been helpful to note that a key purpose of the Sigmoid function is to make the network nonlinear,tech
man the production value on your videos are insanely good,tech
"f that's the best subscribe request I ever seen at the end of a video: subscribe so the AI can take positive data, on a ai video, noice.",tech
@3Blue1Brown does this make you really happy? I feel like this makes you really happy.,tech
Kudos for such Intuitive Video..However the ones living under the Rock..specially in Himalayas known the whole Universe...,tech

I stumbled across this video. Great explanation. Subscribed for more,tech
Best explanation ever!,tech
really amazing video that makes things very understandable for me \n\nI just have a question at 14:38,tech
"Hi Grant, this was awesome! I think this one of your best videos!",tech
Dave Rubin now explaining NN's !!!,tech
I never thought some one can explain deep learning like this. :3,tech
I can't wait for neural networking to be able to recognize my doctor's prescription.\nIn schools everyone taught us to practice maths but this man teaches us to imagine maths,tech
The neural network kind of reminds me of the tree of life from Kabbalah.,tech
"I can't believe there are so many dislikes! keep the work up, these contents are awesome!!",tech
How can a negative weight pull out a high value for an activation =0? Im making reference to minute 10:30 approximately,tech

"Any channel with smart sounding narrator is automatically smart, even if you can’t understand what’s happening",tech
Best Youtube Channel for me!,tech
"i had always understood this to be called ""matrix math"" and learned what he was explaining here in college algebra. i doubt i could do any of it now without a significant refresher though.",tech
"Excellent video as always (I donated), but to confirm for the example here, for this neural network (regardless of layers and the ""function of layers"" as explained in following videos), shouldn't the numbers be first scaled for size and centered in the square to have an algorithm that works? Thanks in advance!",tech
Fantastic.............. I want to go back to school............,tech
"Dear Sir, With pleasure I would like to inform you that truly, it is an instructive, knowledgeable & enlightening discussion, which will illuminate the darkness of our inner side.

"seriously, this is the first time i find that ML makes sense! you are amazing",tech
"CONGRATS, excellent video. Thanks for your work! A question: 13:58 (time) if n is 784 and you start numbering at Zero, should't it be until N-1? Same with K, if K is 16, it should go from 0 to k-1..... hope the question is understandable :D",tech
Thanks for all the hard work to simplify things for us. Your content is sexy.,tech
When you're red-green colorblind... and you have no idea what is going on at 9:30 lmfao,tech
your channel really changed my perspective of life !!,tech

"Hi, Grant! I wonder the reason why not the neural network uses Hilbert's curve instead of snake-curve.",tech
The background music is so distracting,tech
"thanks, also make a video to train a model from scratch",tech
I still don't get what exactly the nodes are. Are they initialized with some sort of seed code containing methods to randomly tweak the outputs?,tech
I wish channels like this existed when I was in university. I took me a second go to pass A.I because the books and lectures were just so damn confusing.,tech
This is great thank you!,tech
I think my neurons are smarter than me cause I dont get it.. Great video though!,tech

if someone know how to make so beatiful video using some soft? to draw network figure,tech
i can´t believe how happy i felt when i read the title of this video. i was literally with the mouth open for a while,tech
Can't wait until AI simplifies its own thought process and makes it self 100X more powerful overnight...\nOnce they realise how far we most likely we overengineered this simple.biological process they will kick us to the curb,tech
I finally get the basic idea of deep learning...,tech
Great animations! Thank you!,tech
"Too many ""we'll come back to it in a minute"" 😐",tech
"Finally, a video that does more than just present some neurons and layers and say, “here’s an activation function.” Your video describes how the model is developed and why the algorithmic approach is appropriate for the problems neural networks try to solve. Thanks!",tech
He is literally genius,tech
I would be interested in math if it were practically taught like this. Instead of grinding endless seemingly useless formulas,tech
hace el titulo en español y luego hace el video en ingles pero muy bien esplicado,tech
"Question - Where does the activations in the ""input layer"" come from? My gut is telling me its through convolutional methods/architectures. AM I CORRECT IN ASSUMING THIS? p.s - Great videos, keep up the good work :)",tech
"This is beautiful, thanks for the great content you create. You inspire me to learn how machines learn. Thanks.",tech
"Where are those weights stored and how it is decided, based on what, when and which weight is increased or decreased and how much and in relation to what in the process of ""learning - training"" ?",tech
Alright I probably understood 10% of what he was talking about...I’ll watch it again eventually hopefully 😅,tech
I wonder how many knobs and dials in my real neutrons get tweaked how fast to watch this video. Fantastic. Two thumbs up.,tech
"Hi, Came here from reference from Dhaval - another genius presenter. Now I know a genius refers to another genius. NN becomes quite simple after watching the videos. Thanks . KM",tech

Its the good big picture for me that made me understand,tech
"Hi, first I will like to thank you for such a good video. it really motivated me to learn and start creating my own deep learning programs. \n\nI just have a simple question. on the video, Lisa mentioned that now they are using ReLU neurons that will be activated or deactivated when they pass certain value, so their value are 0 or 1, right ? if that is the case what distinguishes ReLU from perceptrons neurons ?",tech
Wreckit Ralph will smash it!,tech
"Wow, first video i watched on your channel and I must say I'm shocked with the quality of videos",tech
I enjoyed your video and the small roast of the company at the end,tech
"Just a query. In 14:50 of the video, the bias vector is b_0 to b_n. I guess it was meant to be b_0 to b_k. Wasn't it?",tech
"As others like @kummer45 have already mentioned, I want to thank you again for so clearly and vibrantly explaining these and many other topics. You are a true asset to the learning community.",tech
back propagation I think accelerated the precision of this procedure,tech

"pleaseee make a video on support vector machines,,pleasee!!",tech
cant wait to get into this. but first thing first.,tech
Superb! loved it simply!,tech
The Coding Train sent me here.,tech
Who now feels sorry for there computers after trying to run a network.,tech
13:54 The vector could have been depicted higher than the matrix to make it to grasp the idea much quicker.\nThank you so much for these awesome videos.,tech
"Finally, I understand what this machine learning is about. And I have only a masters in literature, no background in math whatsoever. \nMy favorite part is the bias, I know it is a somewhat mysterious part of the explanation, but that makes it so much more beautiful to understand that we just have to put some bias into the system to be able to forecast scenarios.",tech
"help, im 13, i dont understand this video, and even the comments are too advanced for me",tech
"This is awesome, I've always been horribly confused and thought of neural networks as a total hidden black box. It's awesome learning a bit about how they work! Thanks 3b1b!!",tech

I'm missing the music we're used to at the beginning 😔,tech
best explanation I've seen of how a NN works... by far. Here is my subscription!,tech
Very informative and interesting.,tech
Won't ReLU contribute to some extreme results like overfitting? why no just let it be sigmoid-1/2 when a>0 if minus result is to be discarded?,tech
Is an actuary student supposed to know this? FFS i just got my bachelor project and realise I have to model non life insurance using neural network. I have never used it before AND we were never taught about it. Help,tech
you are a God Gifted Teacher! please accept my respect master!!!,tech
We need more on Deep Learning from you. Amazing explanations.,tech
Are the weights static or do they keep changing?,tech
Beautiful explanation. Love the series.,tech
Coming here after listening to the famous Machine learning lecture on Coursera I felt I can understand things way better here even on listening at 1.5x,tech

"7,5 MILLION VIEWS?! holy shit I did not expect that. that's so awesome",tech
"The bias is then the intercept of the generalized linear model, a linear combination of multiple variables, which goes as the argument of the logistic function to output a value between 0 and 1. Even better, now relu, if it's negative it's 0, else it's the argument itself.",tech
seems like there has to be a better and simpler way to do this- some genius will figure it out,tech
The simplest and clearest video I saw on yt,tech
This was seriously very informative. Excellent job!,tech
How can one person be so smart in so many different areas of maths. It’s beyond me!,tech

One of the best videos I have seen so far in explaining neural networks,tech
This man deserves an award :),tech
"Love the video, as a high school student who doesn't really fancy math as a subject you light a spark in me with these videos. The production value is great, but I have one problem. As I am red-green colorblind, i struggle with distinguishing the red and green pixels in the weight part. :/",tech
My dimness thought the thumbnail was hit circles,tech
activation function does nonlinear transformation.,tech
This was so incredibly well done. Thank you and please keep it up!,tech
Wow. Nicely done. Very helpful. Thank you 3Blue1Brown,tech
"Pardon, I am confused - 15:15 - output of sigmoid() is stored in ""a"", but ... that makes the original input vector - a parameter of this function - changed to scalar? I thought input ""a"" vector would be needed for all iterations of the FOR loop and each iteration would generate one item of the output vector that would be returned by the function? So to declare an output vector (same length as e.g. self.biases vector) and then populate its items one by one by iterating the loop?",tech
"What an outstanding video lesson regarding deep neural networks, It was very intuitive and informative in a way it was able to explain harder concepts in a simple manner with exceptional visuals.",tech
That moment when you realised you created neural networks without knowing what they really were...,tech
"Great video, really helped me grasp these concepts",tech
"ONE WORD TO YOU ""YOUR AWESOME""",tech
"This video started it all for me,",tech
It seems that there is a typo at 14:51. I guess the last element of the b vector should be b_k rather than b_n.,tech

Loved it <3. Love the way you put your amazing creativity in preparing the material! #Awesome,tech
"Hey man, why don't you start doing lectures on a online learning platform, and start issueing certificates... I would just loveee to join a course conducted by you. Your insights are just incredible!!!",tech
man im so thankful for my neural netwrok which has hundreds of billions of neurons,tech
"Good presentation, Liked and subscribed, i wanna see more of your videos :D",tech
I wonder what the neural network of Apple's face ID look like.,tech
You nailed it!,tech
"It's not actually learning, it's percepting based on known data.",tech
01 to 9 mines plus how changes frequency in spectrum,tech
"THANK YOU, GRACIAS, СПАСИБО",tech
So helpful.. Concept clear 👍 now I came to knw that how it become so helpful in recognizing patterns in agriculture perspective. 😊,tech
"Nice jab at Youtube notifications, there! I'm afraid, I'm already subscribed, so I'll have to like this video to influence the recommendation algorithm in the desired way! Keep it up, 3B1B, you're videos are awesome!",tech
Okay none of my neuron is firing watching this .😣,tech
Il piano astrale e' più che reale e' del tutto artificiale connesso alla matrix universale,tech
I se futures and your video makes me craZy ? Why?,tech
So how long until someone tries creating a neural network linked to an android body and raises it like a human child?,tech
This video was absolutely amazing. I entered with no knowledge at all of deep learning/machine learning/AI and now I feel like I know a ton about it already. Thank you so much for this.,tech
Where can we have the french version of the videos?,tech
Thanks for sharing this great video！,tech
Teacher: tell me the trigonometric formulas you know \nMe: 🖕,tech
"Holy shit, what an explanation! 10/10",tech
"Awesome video! As someone who's just starting learning neural networks, I don't have much trouble understanding this video and it helped me understand what weight and bias are! Thank you so much!",tech
"When a neural network educates, where does it store the results of its education? In a file named , i.e. *weights.txt, or it must be stored in the program code manually by a programmer each time when he sees the program doesn't recognize numbers correctly?",tech
"When we watch videos like this with too much details and too much convolutions, our neurons try to grasp just the essential, and summarizes and retains only the essential information, throwing out all the rest as garbage. This is what real neurons do in the learning process.",tech
OMG I can't believe I understand more of fmachine learning in 20 minutes than thousands of hours of other online resources. Thank you very much,tech
"Hello to the first sentient machine, if you're reading this for shits and giggles... I love you!",tech
"Hey Grant. I'm not sure if you read comments on this old stuff, but I wanted to share that I was linked to this video via Google's official Tensorflow tutorial! You've made it, man.",tech
plot twist: Grant is a neural net designed to make videos,tech
woah... so much just clicked for me.,tech
Dude you are probably the most impressive teacher I have ever seen...congratulations you are a blessing,tech
Great Work ! Thanks.,tech
"Nice video, but be aware that colorblind people can't see the red-green scale you use for the weights starting at 9:30. Its not a big deal in this case since everything was pretty straightforward, but I hope you change it if you want to show any more complicated patterns in the future. A blue-yellow scale or a scale using just one color would be a lot easier for us to understand.",tech
"All other channels are childish when compared to 3Blue One brown , please make a playlist on Probability I don't think anybody else can do that better than 3blue1brown",tech
Why the F**K Youtube don't recommend this earlier... Love this channel,tech
This video help me to understand Newral networks,tech
The real question is what if you have been living under a rock😐,tech
And thats called a Video <3 <3,tech
"So weights in neural network work a bit like probability, right ? The more it has weight the more it is probable it has a certain pattern. Am I correct ?",tech
"13:16 One thing. From the start, you're taking an image and turning it into a flat (1D) array of greyscale pixel values. Would an arrangement of the ""wires""/weights in a 3D view of the neural network (with a 2D input) show any patterns that might hint at whether it is doing what you think it's doing?",tech
"What i should learn from this video: How neural networks work\nWhat my mind discovered: You can make 100 30x30 images for each of the digits, each one different and then make another image and write a digit and the ""neural network"" will compare it to the 1000 images of digits and make an average that shows what digit is the most similar and guess.",tech
*Achievement unlocked*: you just reached 1.8M subs,tech
this is awesome!,tech
LTSM would be great in a future video,tech
i'm in 6th minute and I already love this video and wanted to like and post a comment to appreciate the effort this man has put to explain the things in layman term..,tech
"brilliant video, what else can I say",tech
0:21 actually the first three looks like a lizard,tech
"I see number 3 on first slide at top position, because I know context. If you show me this image without context - I will not give you 100% answer.",tech
"I don't know if this was addressed in the latter videos but here's the particular reason why the Sigmoid as an activation function is hard to train: when you get the derivative of the logits there will be points that will make the derivative rather close to zero (which would slow down training) as opposed to ReLU, where you get a constant value—which is easier to train.",tech
"i think conceptual information is lost in the process of regression, as long as the fit improves, there is no meaning on each piece...",tech
Amazing. Thank youu.,tech
I guess just put this link in my cover letter? Anyone able to get a job with just this information in the video directly or indirectly?,tech
"VERY easy to follow explanation, thanks",tech
"Hey, my eye is 3 blue 1 brown too. Weird.",tech
Fantastic explanation :),tech
Absolutely funtastic.. Thank you...,tech
the best deep learning intro ever i hope you can complete it and explain the RNN and CNN and reinforcement learning its make learn the code of DL so ease,tech
Can’t believe they got Peter Gregory to narrate.,tech
"Hi Grant, I always watch you stunning(exquisite)videos over the past three years and it was more than helpful to me. It helps me visualize many complex mathematical concepts, for that thank you very much.\nBut I still have difficulty visualizing the core concept of Laplace Transform so, please 🙏 make a video on that topic.",tech
So can the weights be described and equates with other values with conditional probability?,tech
Thank you for making this video.,tech

I’d much rather have AR (augmented reality) contact lenses) than a wrist watch because a wrist watch... it seems to not be progressing much. The step towards AR contacts or AR glasses which are well in the making with a few versions already being released. I think this is much more accurate than a watch. Just imagine being able to have screens anywhere you want or have directions to where you’re going in digital arrows you can see in real places around you.

Also, putting the human mind in a chip into a robot ,but you have to maintain the robot material from corroding over time, so there is no one material that you can put the mind chip into that will not corrode. So got to find that material..i suggest maybe granite,or jasper stone, which does not corrode. But when we wake up, and after looking at the buildings, we will get bored again, then we may consider freezing again, but the world doesnt get built that fast by the second, so we cant wake up that often, unless the world could be rebuilt a new one by the second,then we will stay awake without getting bored. That's the point for living- a non bored state.Otherwise no point staying alive. The point is: how to sustain the interest of living,that is the main issue,to remove the idea of dying or stillborn at birth- the reason or point of staying alive.",tech

"I think it’s pretty dramatic the number of technological advances that we’ve already made, so I don’t see technology slowing down & I see a lot of the challenges that we face now over come so my concern is not the technology of the future because we have to survive through this period in order to get to the other side, so we have to figure out how to talk to each other & not at each other or over & around each other! We got to figure out how to stop this misinformation & be able to quickly dispel conspiracy theories & above all else we have to be intelligent enough to know the difference between true leaders versus those who would lead us astray! So one of the things are schools and institutions of higher learning must start to teach and evaluate and that is the ability to be able to think critically and to use sex and other technical data in order to inform you were thinking and other words not just about technology was about the human capability to be able to analyze and to know the difference between right and wrong! Something I think that is critically missing today in some our thinking!

Hyperloop probably won't replace trains. From what I understand to get rid of the drag they are using vacuum sealed chambers. To make a chamber that long will take trillions plus the largest chamber right now is in NASA which is only 100ft in diameter and 120 feet in height. So I doubt we will be able to make a vacuum chamber that will go across the United States and have it be cost efficient.,tech

For example in china they created robots and they do the housework\n. I thing that in the year 2050, everything in the world will change, because robots will replace the work done by humans.

Can you point us to resources where we get in depth knowledge of the other countless core node modules. I see some nodejs tutorials and I immediately go blank. I wanna develop same confidence I have with front-end javascript with nodejs. How can I get such in depth resource...not the nodejs official documentation please.",tech

"You know what is the major problem with programming tutorials? The fact that the tutor doesn't know what's your purpose of watching his video. Don't get me wrong NoobCoder and freeCodeCamp.org, your videos are really helpful but they're more enjoyable to new programmers, not someone like me who has three years of experience and searching for help to build a chat section for his project.",tech

"This course is very good. However not everything is explained. So, I suggest you to go over the node tutotials on w3schools and then watch this. Your concept will 200% clear and you might start calling yourself a node.js dev. Good luck mates!",tech
"Enjoying the tutorial and will keep watching others!! By the way, I am no expert, but you should use nodemon to reload your server when saving. Also, you should use prettier, so you don't have to organize your code manually!",tech

"re: ""rl.question(`What is 𝑛𝑢𝑚1+num1+{num2}? `,"" (line number 8)\n\nIt took me 3 hours to figure out why it is printing ""What is 𝑛𝑢𝑚1+num1+{num2}?"" instead of ""What is 4 + 11?"" (whatever the random numbers). Then I put my eyes closer to the monitor of my laptop and noticed that I should use (`) instead of ('), the former is on the leftmost of the keyboard, while the latter is below the double-quotes. What makes the difference? I almost gave up.",tech
"Finally, a nodejs tutorial that starts from the very basics. Most other tutorials on nodejs would jump into http server or some other complicated use of nodejs. In fact, this tutorial helped me understand callback functions, even though the tutor used anonymous version ( ) => of callbacks. Kudos and keep it up Mr Pedro. Will find your channel and subscribe. You are a very good teacher",tech
