5,At first I read “how I manage my personal fiancees”
6,THAT PART. “Most people take out a credit card to buy things they can’t afford.”
7,Takeaway: The leather jacket was worth it.
8,Takeaway: Don't buy a leather jacket.
9,I wish more youtubers would share their personal finances like Matt does. I’m also opening a vanguard Roth IRA
10,Is anyone else freaked out that Matt isn’t wearing a grey t-shirt?? 😱😱
11,"Basic personal finance:
✅ Don't spend money you don't have i.e. if you can't pay in cash you can't buy it
✅ Save a % of your income i.e. don't spend all you have
✅ Focus on making more money instead of living frugally"
12,Matt D’Avella is more educational in life than high school.
13,"Getting to the point of debt free is one of the greatest accomplishments in your 20s. I'm close to paying off all of my high interest credit card debt and I have no other liabilities, really excited to have this burden taken off of my shoulders."

17,"""Don't let the fear of doing the WRONG thing, prevent you from doing ANYTHING""
if that doesn't sum up perfectionist procrastination mindset idk what does

Edit: Didn't realize how many people relate with this. Something that helps is knowing nothing is perfect, perfect is subjective to the individual, you're competing with your own standards. So just start, fail, learn, that's what perfection really is. Not nailing it in one shot."
18,This is the sleekest native advertisement I've seen in a while. Sneaky AF.

24,"This video is going to blow up for sure, amazing work!"

26,One of the best value channels on YT 🔥🔥🔥

33,Great stuff. I watch several youtube videos on how to trade in the stock market but haven't made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it.
34,"Nice video❗❗ loved the way you broke it down. Stock investment is the most profitable way of making a high income passively, weekly or monthly. Although most people just log on to youtube to get info on the stocks to pick, without basic understanding on portfolio selection and risk tolerance. I'll advice beginners to invest with a stock broker to guide you through and also work on your investing tolerance and risk management."
35,"I have come to realize that the stock market is really vast that why as a beginner you will achieve close to nothing investing on your own without proper guidance, I will recommend LInda Anne Werner for beginners and investor who are having hard times making good profits off the market also to avoid the mistake I made as a beginner investing on my own."

206,"Be careful who you give your money because trading is no joke nor investment a gamble. Often times, there is always a misplaced priority because the core reason for having a trading strategy is to remove the possibility of you making emotional or irrational decisions. Decisions should be authenticated or rather made based on predefined parameters that are developed with clear logical thinking. One more advantage is the possibility to benefit from repetition. Without this type of strategy, you probably won’t know what worked or why it worked and even if you did, it would be hard to repeat.

302,"The next question for EUR/USD traders is whether even more money will flow in 1Q from the relative safety of the us Dollars into assets seen as more risk,and that includes the Euro.such a move seems likely as the coronavirus pandemic comes under control:another positive factor for EUR/USD. Note though that there is also risk that the pandemic persists,leading to renewed safe-haven demand for Dollars and a pullback in EUR/USD before further strength emerges.Getting the right trading foundation and analysis make landfall a strong ground for profit inflows, I use "

386,I have been saving money for years as I dont pay for rent etc. I am in hvac and make some good money but I dont spend money as well so I just save a large portion of my earnings but I'm started noticing how I'm missing out by not investing. This video helped me feel more confident.
387,"A lot of people are not financially stable this period and it's not easy. I always advise people don't just waste your stimulus checks or salary invest it in something that will yield more, even if it is a part of it. We can't keep relying on a paycheck that is already half spent before we even receive it, there are investment opportunities that have helped a lot of people especially in the financial market. Having different streams of making money is the solution to survive in this pandemic, especially now most of us have to earn and work from home, I've made impressive profits so far this year and it has helped me sort out a lot of bills and I do that through a registered investment company. You can get in touch with the dedicated broker via Whatap: +..1..9..7..2.. 9..4..7..8..9..0..8  he will guide you through. It's highly recommendable"
388,Great video!! Thanks for the hard work and time you put into it 🙂
389,"My uncle lost most of his retirement money watching CNBC during the DOTCOM era. Just because it's an ""entertaining"" channel be careful when they bring on a CEO from a company talking it up. It's YOUR money that you work(d) for, so please use caution and don't get hooked up on  them."

General bullish moves has being productive to hodlers and traders the same, with everybody anxious to get a bit of crypto currency at the present time! Although i fancy trading over hodling, because of its productivity and extra information on crypto by and large. Overtime, i have used lots of signal service and guide from experts to assist with trading, one of those experts has been central to most of the trading successes i have enjoyed.. Jayson Brian's administration is one of the productive ones I have utilized, and I would suggest him for crypto related difficulties.

457,"Thank you for your TA, some of the best on YT. 2020 was quite a year, and what is a better news for crypto than to see all-time highs at the years end? Both institutions and high-net-worth investors are starting to acknowledge Bitcoin as a store of value and as a treasury asset. Happy to be a partaker of such a change in the world of crypto, I know some hodlers are happy at the moment due to the recent rise, although you aren't supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts. That's why it was never second-guessing when an opportunity as crypto tradlng came my way. ""Why hold a currency you can multiply or grow?"" With much energy channeled into tradlng bitcoin daily with unique slgnals, it was no surprise how my portfolio went from 3 Bitcoin to 19 Bitcoin within a year. I will always advlse anyone who just started dealing with Bitcoin or old holders, Trad e people! It is truly easy, only requires your time. I registered with a Crypto mentor on Te.leqram mssngr Tony Max who helped me grow my crypto portfoIio all the way to the top. @Tony_signal22 on Te.leqram or wh*ts*pp + 1 7 1 4 9 4 2 5 6 3 9 made 2021 a blissful one."

I think I’ll let other hold the bag this happens anytime something moons.I’ve seen with Bitcoin in 2020 in the sliver market,the oil market,housing and even about individual stocks.when something moons like this,sorry you are too late.

Both institutions and high-net-worth investors are starting to acknowledge Bitcoin as a store of value and as a treasury asset. Happy to be a partaker of such a change in the world of crypto, I know some holders are happy at the moment due to the recent rise, although you aren't supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts. That's why it was never second-guessing when an opportunity as crypto trading came my way. ""Why hold a currency you can multiply or grow?"" With much energy channeled into trading bitcoin daily with unique signals, During my first 5 weeks of trading with Abrams Taylor daily signals, i was able to grow my portfolio from 1.1btc to 6.2btc. I will always advice anyone who just started dealing with Bitcoin or old holders, Trade people! It is truly easy, only requires your time. Abrams can be reached on Whatspp.+ 1828-547-3110 and Telegram @ abrams_signals7 for inquiries into profitable trading systems"

576,"I've always been interested in Finance and apart from a few very basic high school/college classes most of what I've come to understand has come from simply spending time trying to read Rich Dad Poor Dad (not much of a big book reader but I try), watch Jim Cramer Graham Stephen and of course Dave Ramsey.....and try to watch finance specific videos on each subject when I can but I've never jumped into any courses or programs because frankly there seems to be a million of them come across my youtube and Instagram feeds as I get more interested. Also I'm naturally a 'saver' in general and do not spend frivolously. In fact I've kind of adopted more minimalist attitudes and no longer even want a lot of the stuff my family has acquired. Lot of stuff left over from when my parents downsized from a 5 bedroom home we lived in for 15 years that even after many goodwill and trash dumps I still have left over. I sort of took it as a personal challenge rather than dump off the remaining stuff to see if I can sell it and it's sort of become a interesting side hustle if you could call it that lol. I've been able to earn hundreds on just stuff I would have set by the dumpster or given to goodwill which would have then sold it. I was really surprised at what people with buy. I just want to pay off a affordable home and apart from student debt I have no credit card debt. I have long known that just sitting on cash in the bank literally doesn't do anything and always wanted to bite the bullet and jump in even with a small amount like $100-500. Apart from investing all I've really done is Stack Silver because and have small collection of silver eagles. The biggest thing to me was I was always afraid of the tax implications if you make money and when you can pull out your cash if needed and all the different types of penalties. I say all this before I've watched the video but the first 5 minutes was intriguing enough. So hopefully I'll have a little more financial vocabulary and more of a willing to jump in. I'm not sure if there are videos yet or if it will get covered in the video but for me the biggest reason of not jumping in has been fear of taxes and penalties and would love to know more about that side of investing."

607,"BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i would say trading has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 8.5 BTC in just two weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by hackerraid on telegram.His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on TELEGRAM (@HACKERRAID ON TELEGRAM)"

728,"There are innumerable ways to make real money online. A lot of people are interested in buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as an investment. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as going out and buying a stock. Most experts recommend buying Bitcoin and then storing it safely offline in a hardware wallet. I will show you exactly how to do that!
Despite trading sideways for sometime now, there are still so many fundamental reasons to be bullish on bitcoin most prominent been the halving less than 2 months away and the decoupling of btc from the traditional market, making it a safe haven as the economy plunges further. It is also a very smart action to buy now and not by DCA but as much as possible and if trading is not your expertise, then using a signal service like that of Carter Chelsea,which I have been using for over 6 months now, having made over 9 btc in profit, starting from just 3 btc in my first month using his signals. This is in itself the quickest way to hold a good size crypto bag before the asset becomes to expensive to purchase in the near future. Carter Chelsea can be reached on Gmail (Carterels54@gmail.com) or telegram @carterfx_bbo . if his service is needed as he has a lot to offer from my experience with him."

Even though I'm not blind, what she said about ""Making her own life like molding it herself"" and more things that she never stopped her dreams like moving to LA. I realized I'm gonna look up to her my whole life because she made it to where she wanted to be and didnt stop even though she did have bullies. I love her so much and she taught me to never quit on my dreams or goals and just to keep going even when I'm going through a rough time because in the end everything will be better and I will be so happy if I dint let the hate or people get to me. Molly if you hear this I love you so much!!"

1935,Thank you for doing this Molly! It was so fun to watch. Two of my favorite YouTubers together!
1936,this is so cute i live for james being insecure and molly immediately shutting it down
1937,When she says I (see) all these people going to the party.....
1938,Some one should make a way for molly to see things with sparkles
1939,I’ve been switching glasses every 6 months since 1st grade and I’m going into 6th grade and I can only see a couple feet

1957,I love rewatching this now that I’ve watched so many of both of their videos. I feel like I know their personalities so much more. Still such a cute video.
1958,Who else was laughing at the confusion happening 😂
1959,When James scarf fell over his mouth at 15:28 and he just kept talking I died 😂
1960,the real question is..did he invite molly to his morphs life party
1961,“You go Glen Coco!” I love Mean Girls and want to go see it so bad😭❤️❤️
1962,"You SEE all the Beaty gurus go to the launching party’s!,"
1963,I tried to do this to my friend once and I put blush on her forehead
1964,You guys should go shopping together! Where you pick an outfit out for James and then James picks an outfit out for you blindfolded.
1965,"With that part of your face covered, you look like Berry Allen!!!"
1966,I'm still waiting for this apparel collab😂 please make it happen!
1967,Oh goodness I cringed the entire time lol...
1968,That ear contour tho...

1970,Anyone watching after the James Charles scandal
1971,James talking like he's rapping 😂
1972,Literally closed the youtube app down for a second to download facetune after James mentioned it 😂 God knows I need it 😂
1973,"he looks  like he beat you up with makeup but i love this, so awesome!!"
1974,"I'm seriously warming up to James every video of his I see. I always dismissed him as A I don't like doing makeup and B there was so much drama always around the beauty youtuber space. But now I'm seeing him more in collabs, he seems like such a nice guy :)"
1975,"James: look up 


Molly: uhh, erm..."
1976,HI! I subbed from James Charles video on you doing his make-up now I'm watching him to yours! This was a fun video to watch!
1977,"I love the ""I love that for _"" expression for James"
1978,"Seriously,  late on this video but Molly is so beautiful even without makeup :)"
1979,just watched your job on James good job girl 💕
1980,Omg I laughed so hard you guys are so cute “it’s in my lash line” “that sounds like a personal problem”

(James chokes)"
1982,You’re so fucking beautiful oh my goodness!!!!
1983,"""the brush is in my lash line"" ""weeell that sounds like a personal problem"" xD"
1984,james: it’s not THAT bad
1985,James is so sweet. I love how soft he spoke in this video
1986,This is the second video I’ve watched of yous AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU💘💖💗💓💞💝💕
1987,Molly is like a magnificent human if she gets to see I would love to se ever reaction to seeing her beautiful self in the mirror
1988,'I don't clean my eyeshadow brushes'  I loved this line.  I'm so fed up of hearing beauty YouTubers make it out like they clean their brushes every morning after they do their makeup.  Nobody has that much time!  It makes us normal people feel so gross. haha
1989,"“Omg you have Gucci belts I will just like touch them”
-molly"
1990,am I the only one watching this in 2020?
1991,The whole makeup is so messy and I'm laughing SO HARD

1994,Molly you don’t need makeup your gorgeous
1995,Life blindfolded me naturally I literally can't
1996,"I was wondering why this video was recommended to me. I didn't recognize you, Molly"
1997,I just giggled the entire way through this
1998,jolly is such a cute ship name!!
1999,The into scared me when I saw her face.
2000,I absolutely love these colabs! I love how brave you are and I love you guys!
2001,Molly I saw another comment saying this but go to a sketch artist and tell them what you think you look like!
2002,So much love and respect for you ❤️❤️
2003,"I'm loving how all these youtubers are coming together. Youtube as itself has its issues, but the community is stronger than ever. Im living for every single video. I am shister shnatched."
2004,James sounds a little ✨Congested✨
2005,OH my she is gorgeous she has beautiful eye lashes and is so cute and confident!!!!!
2006,Babe hahaha when the blindfold falls down. I’ve never loved James more at that point
2007,"OMG, this is the funniest thing I've watched lately! :)))) I love your collab and the fact that Molly speaks as fast as James. :)) Finally, a worthy opponent. You 2 are great, thank you!"
2008,"Aww, I knew that Molly had some light and shadow perception, but really thought it was more like, silhouettes in front of bright lights, or how she sees headlights/street lamps/etc in her very unique way. But I had no idea she could see sparkly/reflective things in her hands. I'm sure if I'd actually taken the time to think about how light reflects and how it's no different than how she can see a lamp that's on, it would've made perfect sense, but I just didn't think about it. Her recognizing the Stila product surprised me, and I thought I was all done with surprises after viewing for so long and living in the disability community for so much of my life! I love learning/realizing something new every day!"
2009,This is painful to watch 😂
2010,"This is literally me when I ‘try’ to do my makeup.
🤣"
2011,Just saying molly is so pretty love you molly you inspire me every day I may not be blind but inspire me to be kind and have a heart of gold❤❤

2090,"Molly it is so amazing how calm and comfortable you make James, it is truly inspiring. A lot of the time in his videos he is uptight and fast, it is hard to appreciate what he has to say, but the videos you’ve done together have showed a wonderful side to him that I’m glad I got to see.

2141,"Hi Molly, I just found your YouTube and i can’t without u! You’re such an inspiration! 
I love how you can do that eye contact thing! 💜💜💜"
2142,I love your intro!!!
2143,I came here after Molly's video of 10 years ago I went blind. Keep going you're so inspirational!💜
2144,Your so beutifull!
2145,But did you invite her to your palette party
2146,How do you do emojis when editing?
2147,"James was so close on the palette, he flipped the greenish and the dark blue shades."
2148,You should collab with simply nailogigal
2149,I just subed I found you on James channel and I came over here to watch you and I think your a good YouTube
2150,She loves shiny and glittery things?? Does that mean she's a HOLOSEXUAL? She needs to collab with her fellow Canadian Simply Nailogical!!
2151,I’ll do your lashes for free!
2152,this is so iconic! x
2153,He's so cute omg
2154,Y'all look like y'all could be related in this video!
2155,She should put highlighter all over her face and see if she can see her facial structure in a mirror because of the reflection. Something like cover fx custom enhancing drops thats really blinding
2156,Anyone here after the sister scandal?!
2157,Is it weird that sometimes I forget she is blind 😂
2158,"So, your speeking over people. Try to let people talk. 

Love you Molly!"
2159,OMG MOLLY you are such a HUGE Insprasion to me anda sooooo many other people you just keep on doing you and everyone Will love u

2162,This is delicious 😋
2163,Omg I have so many questions
2164,"“I see all these people going to launch parties and it looks so fun” -Molly, who can’t see things that look fun 😂😍 love you so much girl 😍😍"
2165,“i’m all sistered out” 😂😂
2166,"She did wonderful and he failed

2167,"question for molly!

2168,Omg bird box to the fullest 😂
2169,Oh no! He made Molly look like she was socked in the face! 😂🙈 great video! So fun! Good collab!
2170,The bronzer 😂😂😂 dead

2178,Laughed so hard on 10:36 when she left her face on his sleeve! Molly is the best!!
2179,#jolly❤️
2180,I feel like there is an artist out there that could make a 3d art project of mollys face using light and shadow... in my head it makes sense.
2181,All you need to know about how you look is that you look beautiful
2182,When he was listing all the colors blindfolded I was sister dining
2183,"Molly, you are naturally GORGEOUS!"
2184,Me an my friend did this challage
2185,"James: It doesn't look that bad

2194,"Molly: are you doing any liner or....

2200,#BlendLikeYoureBlind
2201,He really do be sister stupid when it comes to where the eyeshadows are
2202,"Molly, I found you through Shane Dawson just like James and ever since you’ve been my fave you tuber!"
2203,That highlighter is on point and contour sister snatched I've been a sister since the beginning and love the SISTER SQUAD
2204,11:58 emma chamberlain who?
2205,When he contoured her ear I was dying 💕😂💕
2206,Thank God she's pretty! 😂
2207,12:41 welp.. unleash your inner artist🤷‍♀️💕
2208,"I’m late to the video but, I have an idea. You could get an artist to draw your face but in SPARKLES and GLITTER so that you can see it. So basically you would be able to see what you look like but just in glitter."
2209,No hate comment here. ❤️ I love you guys so much!
2210,"What I don't get is, how can you bully someone for going blind? Seriously? I don't care what problems you have, how can you bully someone for going blind? Anyways, awesome video! I love that Molly is a motivational speaker, she is so inspiring. I love how sassy she is. She has literally taken life by the balls and given it a huge middle finger."
2211,Molly Burks intro be like 👁️👄👁️
2212,I hope he invites her to a launch party😂💖
2213,15:19
2214,I can't wait for the purple make-up video!
2215,"I love how chill Molly is about being blind. She's okay with jokes and actually makes them a lot herself, instead of being like, ""That's so offensive! You're so rude!"" She is incredibly inspirational and positive. We need more people like this in the world."
2216,Molly making fun of James saying “life is so hard” lol giving him the pep talk about not able to be a perfectionist and girl if a blind girl can do it you can too👏🏻👏🏻 love molly
2217,15:25 lol
2218,23:45
2219,These two are so qyoot 💜💜💜
2220,"Omg James was so cute when he said ""I wanna make, I wanna make it good"" 10:45"
2221,My grandma also says to me how do you put lipstick on without a mirror I’m like second nature
2222,He switched the green and dark blue
2223,"When James sticks the brush in her eye and is just like ""that seems like a you problem"" 😂"
2224,Lol James you missed the ear- 5:28
2225,MOLLY YOU SHOULD COLLAB WITH LAURDIY AND DO A DIY CHALLENGE WITH HER
2226,Hacen una linda pareja 😭
2227,I'm here from James' channel 💞 subscribed 😊
2228,If I was James with all that money I wouldn’t use I wold do the same thing that the ace family did for Ryan
2229,This was halarious.
2230,#blendlikeyoureblind 😂
2231,You should have a professional draw what u think james looks like
2232,This was eye opening (haha!)  I didn't  know James was going blind OMG😲  SO adorable you guys together!!  💗  funny 😃
2233,Jolly Barles ❤️🥰😍
2234,I thought the thumbnail was Lisa 😂😂😂
2235,"If Id been blind for the past ten years and magically got the ability to see, I'd probably spend hours analyzing myself in the mirror lmao"
2236,I think she looks beautiful like a painting!  I actually like the look especially around the eyes - reminds me of a painting.
2237,15:25 😂😂😂 why is that funny
2238,Lol I think that it's kinda hilarious that James thought he had an advantage although... Like... Obviously the person who does her makeup blind on the regular would be better at it 😂 but it was sweet how confident he was
2239,My best friend and I just did a blind folded makeup challenge and it was hilarious ! It looks nothing like this though 😂he did a good job ! We butchered each other’s faces
2240,"Molly, question...
Which video did you record first?"
2241,jolly!!!!! amazing
2242,at the beginning they looked like brother and sister hahaha
2243,0.75x speed 😂💖👏🏽
2244,Molly is one of my favourite person right now 😍❤️ I JUST ADORE HER 🙌🏻
2245,Ship name: Jolly
2246,I feel like it would be so interesting for her to do a full face on highlighters !
2247,I looove this !!!!!
2248,"you know what makes me really happy, is to see when people with everyday struggles find the silver lining. Molly is blind, so she, alike she said in James Charles video, could be so depressed and upset about how hard it is, but she dousing. I really appreciate that, that can be really hard for people, I'm really proud of anyone who can do that, not just people who have disabilities. for example, I don't have any disabilities, bur I also love to be happy and find the silver lining in everyday struggles. I also love how she can laugh and make jokes about her disability in a fun way and dousing find that offensive. everybody should try to be as positive a Molly."
2249,She actual looks so pretty
2250,"15:25 - flop

17:42 - sweatshirt irony"
2251,This was fun. I wish Jeffree would do this blind folded too
2252,pls do a how you edit video!
2253,U wonder how you look like let me tell you. You look so beautiful you don't have to worry how u look like
2254,"BLINDfolded

2261,100% I would look in the mirror too.
2262,18:24 if i try make up this would be the result
2263,#jolly who’s watching in 2o2o?
2264,James is better at makeup than me even when he is blindfolded 😂
2265,Damn girl... I'm not blind but you inspire me!
2266,THE literal first challenge I've seen that James didn't slay lol
2267,THAT HIGHLIGHT IS POPPING 👏🏻❤️
2268,Molly thank you for starting this channel my son is blind and he listens to all your videos you gave him the power to stand up for himself.. Thanks love
2269,Sister mom 😂
2270,Birdbox tutorials 🤣
2271,Molly how did you recover from your depression?
2272,This had me laughing so hard. Molly did a much better job on James.
2273,He do pretty well
2274,molly is so frickin cute i decidedly love her so much
2275,Ur acc so stunning😘
2276,"For every one Who calls her out on “fakeing being blind”when she looks at the camera her eyes quiver, which are her retinal’s unable to focus,so there,so y’all can leave.I love you Molly and how much confidence you have ❤️"
2277,"I just realized, James did the Bird Box challenge before it was even a thing lol. Go James!!!"
2278,Who’s here after the sugar bear drama
2279,These tow are too cute!!!!
2280,"dude come here, it's rosa from 2020"
2281,"""Oh my god you have Gucci belts?? I will just like-..touch them~"" I love Molly, that made me laugh so hard"
2282,"confused as to why hes blindfolded when without contacts or glasses hes literally blind, not as blind as molly but legally blind.. lol"
2283,"# jolly
That's amazing!!!"
2284,#JOLLY!!!!💖💖
2285,"Sisters, this was fabulous!"
2286,"I always think “why her”? She’s so positive, bubbly, and genuinely an amazing person. Why of all people in this world does SHE have to be blind? But then I realize that’s exactly why. She’s so positive that she can turn something that would normally be so negative, so bright and shiny. No one deserves to lose their vision but she is such an inspiration to others, I think her purpose in life is to inspire and teach others to be positive and gracious. I love you Molly, you’re so amazing"
2287,Both Molly (Burke) and Jenna (Marbles) were going full mom on James when he was doing their makeup.
2288,Who else is watching this in 2020? just me ok.            🚪🏃🏼‍♀️
2289,"molly: I SEE all these beauty gurus going to launch parts and it LOOKS soo fun
me: wait what!?!"
2290,Sometimes I forget you’re blind
2291,“Well that sounds like a personal problem” lmaoooo 😂😂😂
2292,"you are beautiful, molly!!!!!!"
2293,James casually contouring Molly's ear
2294,do you dare challenge the molly!?
2295,Id love to see you guys collaborate again. And James could do a full glam look but without the blindfold :D
2296,if someone told me james and molly were siblings (sisters) i would believe you
2297,Sad to say this'll definitely be the last video I'll watch with her in it. I thought she was so sweet in James' video but she's a little too outgoing and too talkative. Being that I watch James Charles that shouldn't be a problem but this'll be it for me! I'm glad James is collaborating with new people and hope Molly got new followers that love and respect her channel ❤️
2298,Who saw the thumbnail and it looked like Emma? 😂😂
2299,how can he end up with orange when he knew where the purple was 😂😂😂
2300,"After this struggle, catch Sister James making an all accessible makeup line."
2301,"I like that James is so inspired by her, but I also like that Molly said she doesn't want to be idolized and put on a pedestal for simply existing, but rather make people aware and grateful for what they have. Good stuff!"
2302,I wanna compare my vision to James's vision and I want to know who's vision is worse cus I have terrible vision
2303,You did ... good 🤷‍♀️
2304,"I wonder how you can cut your videos so well blind! Do you have a program that cuts, writes and reads for you? ❤️❤️❤️"
2305,"I’m new and I have a question... can u see computer screens, cuz u can see lights right? I’m just wondering.. not trying to be offensive or anything!!❤️"
2306,Unrealated but my middle name is Jane and whenever I say it people think I’m saying James because I usually talk pretty fast and my last name is Charles so it seems like James Charles and it’s kinda funny. And welcome to my TED talk
2307,Is it just me or do they look like siblings and I love itttttf
2308,Who is here to James Charles? 😋
2309,conclusion: molly only has gay friends
2310,MOLLY HAS THE CUTEST FRECKLES WHAT
2311,James rummaging through the makeup is me trying to find my happiness😩😂
2312,i just have a hard time believing she’s blind..
2313,Lol😂 13:43
2314,U did well James. Love u sis
2315,"I ""SEE"" ALL THESE BEAUTY GURUS GOING TO THESE LAUNCH PARTIES"
2316,your so inspiring 😊
2317,#Mames
2318,moll tidily mocked jams oh the 😩 struggle haha🤣
2319,Molly.... I <3 u and all but.. why did you show was the final result in the thumbnail??😫
2320,#blendlikeyourblind. 👏🏻Honestly. Iconic. 👏🏻
2321,James talks to fast and keeps cutting her off....
2322,"I can totally relate to him binge watching on your videos coz that's where i am at after discovering you on colleen's channel. I legit watch some of your videos over and over again because interestingly, I'm not blind but i can relate so much to you."
2323,"James nervously ""but i wanna make it good!😥"
2324,He is doing good
2325,"9:11 ""I don't do that"" (Doesn't memorize the colors in the palette)   

*names all of them correctly 😂"
2326,#Jolly for life ❤
2327,"Molly:I did James makeup but without a blindfold because life blindfolds me naturally 
I died 😂"
2328,I like how when she said not even robots are perfect she added YET
2329,#Jolly love you guys ❤️❤️💜💜
2330,This collab is perfect! Having Molly show sister James that you cant control your life and be perfect all the time... thats one thing he stresses about so much that he forgets to have a good time and live in the moment and just let loose. Loved this video <3
2331,He does makeup better blindfolded than I do when seeing😂🤦🏼‍♀️
2332,You should of gave him the blind goggles you used for Shane Dawson
2333,She looks like the morning after a party!!! Lol
2334,i just realized she looked like emma chamberlain with face makeup
2335,We love sponsoring shister James’s merch 💖💖💖
2336,how they do makeup in bird box
2337,you should do a video where you outline your body in lights that way when you look in to a mirror u can at least see you out line!
2338,Love the pep talk Molly gives James at 12:55 it must be all the motivational speaking she does
2339,"If you drew a picture on tracing paper over a light tablet, would you be able to see it?"
2340,#blendlikeyoureblind
2341,I just started to watch the video and 3:29...Oh James! Lol I know it's hard though.
2342,"So basically, Molly is better at makeup than James!... 😂 ❤️💕💄😍"
2343,he got a 2/4 good job sister💜💜💜
2344,This entire video is James when he was 14
2345,"“Hand me a mirror!” 
*Looks at eyeshadow and puts the mirror back down*"
2346,amazing
2347,"Wait, did James call Molly cute? SHIP IT! Lol"
2348,omg Molly I hope some how u can see this comment but you are beautiful. girl you are an absolute QUEEN!!!!
2349,Anyone in 2020 ?
2350,Molly your probably not going to see this but I just wanted to say thank you for representing the disabled community in such a positive way. I’m 16 wheelchair bound and I’ve always advocated for a change in society in how we are viewed. I think you are making a real impact so thank you. Love you. 💕
2351,Ilu molly! Inspiration to us all
2352,She is so gorgeous!
2353,#birdboxmakeup 😂😂
2354,7:13 #BLEND LIKE YOUR BLIND
2355,Like I understand that she lost her vision at 14 but I am amazed at how normal her body language is. My sister has been blind since birth and her body language makes it super obvious that she’s blind so it’s weird seeing how normal Molly looks
2356,Molly u should try to make your own makeup with lots of glitter ✨
2357,I’m so curious how he managed to contour her nose better than her cheeks 😢
2358,Hostestly I didn't know what makeup was until I was 8-9 and I'm 11
2359,How did they know the camera stopped recording lol just a thought
2360,"I don't know what else to say besides the fact that I completely adore Molly. Her gratitude, for the things she does have, puts me in such a good mood and makes me feel so thankful. xoxo"
2361,I want to be a makeup artist but I was told I can't do it
2362,"no disrespect to you sister, i struggle to type without looking at the keyboard--- how do you do it? x"
2363,Molly ur adorable 🥰🥰🥰🥰
2364,#blendlikeyourblind!
2365,I kept waiting on James to shove his pinky finger in Molly's nose lol
2366,I love how you can joke about being blind not in a rude way but I love how can make what you're going through into a very good positive and not a negative have a great day 😊😊😊😊😊
2367,Molly you are so perfect and pretty
2368,Yessss ship name JOLLY
2369,who else thinks that james should come out with braille makeup
2370,I know these two are super nice highlights points at two bright oranges
2371,I loved this video 💕💕
2372,"When he started putting more contour on that one side of her face I was like ""NO James NOT MORE CONTOUR!"" then he started covering her ear I was like ""NO James NOT ON HER EAR!.... Whelp, now her ear is brown..."" XD"
2373,Do James and Molly really need makeup they are beautiful with out it
2374,How do u do ur vids when ur blind also I love ur vids
2375,"Molly, why are you so adorable?!"
2376,#JollyMames

2381,Who else just came from James’s video?
2382,"Awe, Molly you have picked the right words, for protectionist's."
2383,How does James do eyebrows better than me even when he’s blindfolded
2384,He Got mixed up with the dark blue and the green : (
2385,"Can we get a James, Molly and Shane collab?!!!?!"
2386,Don’t you just love Molly’s inspirational mini pep talks?
2387,Does she have a semicolan behind her ear I love it if so
2388,Sister Samantha is shook xD
2389,"Are they related 
They look so alike
I am so sister shook"

2391,"Molly reminds me of Demi lavato with a little bit of Debby Ryan 
Love you both ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
2392,do a non blind folded makeup video where you just do each others makeup and get to know one another.so a makeup and chat video basically
2393,I used to do my makeup on the backroads if Kentucky.
2394,Could you please do a collab with Sofie Dossi and/or SimplyNailLogical? SimplyNailLogical is Canadian and Sofie Dossi is a contortionist 😊😋

2403,I have questions how can you type and wright
2404,The lighting is so bbaadddd
2405,I love how James randomly grabs Molly's hand 19:53 😂😂😂💜💜💜
2406,If lights turn on and off in a room can you see the change?
2407,"James- the contour can be a make it or brake it

Also James- goes so ham with it and breaks it"
2408,We just did this challenge 🖤 check it out

2413,2019 anyone.......... ok just me
2414,Omg did molly go to his launch ?!!
2415,I love the part where she's just casually talking and then there's James over there struggling to find what he needs😂 #mylife
2416,Looking like twins at the beginning
2417,Who else thought that James picked up undies instead of a blindfold LOL😂
2418,Oh my god loooooooooooool
2419,If she can only see glitter and shiny things then where’s the collar with jojo siwa?!!
2420,hello people James sent me hehe
2421,I feel so bad i have to skip a part of this video because of my phobia of sirens I'm sorry 😭😭
2422,Molly is litterly so adorable and the cutest girl in the world ugh so jealous
2423,He did pretty well with the colors
2424,I would totally buy merch from you
2425,At the end i realized that James could have been cheating the whole time because Molly couldnt call him out but he is to honest to do that💗
2426,Wow who is loving #jolly or #mames

2451,Is it just me or do they look like they could be related?? Like cousins??
2452,this is a dumb question but do you have a brail (i cant spell it) keyboard? or do people have to help type? i feel like for me personally it would be hard to tell what you're typing and watching
2453,Died when his scarf slipped and covered his whole face.
2454,I often do my makeup without a mirror and I'm sighted

2468,"OMG WHEN I CAME AND SUBBED HER IT WAS 1,600,000 AND THERE IS 1,800,000 NOW"
2469,You should get your makeup done with his sight after the virus is gone
2470,He should do just a normal look on Molly without a blindfold
2471,I love James and Molly's chemistry!!!
2472,Very amazing video well done and I love listening to your videos as I am blind and I am a white cane long cane user
2473,Jolly Barkles

2499,"James is still better than me at makeup, even when when he's blindfolded tbh"
2500,After watching your video with Shane and the video on James channel I started think. I’m a painter. I don’t know what I would do with out art. I’d love to do a collection of works aimed at people with different forms of blindness. What do you think would be the best medium or form. For you I’m guessing more shinny and glittery. For others maybe high textures.
2501,With contour on Molly kinda looks like Emma
2502,MOLLY YOU ARE SOOOOOO AMZING

2808,"In 2002 - 2003, I was a tech rep for my US company in China (and Singapore).  Our Chinese manufacturing partner was in Hangzhou, but our Chinese offices were in Shenzhen and Hong Kong where most of our Chinese sales were, so I had a chance to see the start of the development and innovation process this film so ably explains.  What I saw back then blew me away, but when I got back Stateside no one would credit what I saw developing.  The misunderstanding and complacency among my friends and business acquaintances was striking.  Today we see the consequence of that sort of thinking.  This film ought to be required viewing in our schools and communities.  Thanks!"
2809,"This concept is both terrifying as an engineer and one of the best things to happen for humanity. As an engineer, I would be terrified to live there. To think that I would need to stay one step ahead of everyone else for the rest of my life in order to make any money is a scary concept. Sure, it promotes constant improvement of technologies which is great for the common good, but the concept of having to be the best to stay afloat is a very stressful one. Here in the US, it takes one real great invention or advancement to guarantee someones' financial future. In Shenzhen, you would need to do that every day. It's like having to find gold every time you swing a pickaxe."

And if thine eyes be turned towards justice, choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou choosest for thyself. Humility exalteth man to the heaven of glory and power, whilst pride abaseth him to the depths of wretchedness and degradation. Great is the Day, and mighty the Call! In one of Our Tablets We have revealed these exalted words: 'Were the world of the spirit to be wholly converted into the sense of hearing, it could then claim to be worthy to hearken unto the Voice that calleth from the Supreme Horizon; for otherwise, these ears that are defiled with lying tales have never been, nor are they now, fit to hear it.' Well is it with them that hearken; and woe betide the wayward."""

Its amazing that so many Chinese (largest population in the world) are happy with where they live, and I understand - in my 40+ yrs in the states, and having traveled to all its major cities, I never saw such pleasant, clean, and safe cities as those I visited in China. Its a whole different environment."

3621,"I like the summary of the video at the end and share much of my thoughts with it.  I lived in Shenzhen for 2 years in 2008-2010. Yes, the city grows in an amazing speed and its become even more impressive than ever, but life in there is very much a one-dimensional. I cannot expect many of these successful young expats will still be living in this city when they get into the 30-40s and starting to have families. I just hope this city and the Chinese society as a whole would gradually mature in the next few decades and remain a peaceful force in driving the world in advances and progressions."

The logical solution is fair taxation of robot work and automation. The money goes in the pot of a basic income for everyone.

4205,It kills me that I'm old enough to not only have been alive but old enough to REMEMBER all those camcorders because I did a LOT of research before purchasing my first camcorder back in the early '90s. I still own that same camcorder today along with about a hundred different others I've accumulated throughout the years!
4206,"Scary, mobile phone replaced walkman/ipod and most digital cameras / video cameras as they record 4k on new ones and photos are amazing on them.   Still have SLR cameras if professional and maybe a separate digital camera, but for most people phone does everything.   With Netflix etc its defo better now than back in the day."

Edit: it was the next model, I think. The size was similar, and the color palette (red and black) was the same, but the one I had looked a wee bit more advanced, and a wee bit smaller."
4225,It's the same camera Marty McFly used in Back to the Future
4226,Keep being awesome
4227,"Is nobody gonna talk about Casey saying

""Am i here because of my advanced age"""
4228,"Nightmares are returning with this old tech. But, enjoyed this video Cheers!"

4253,"This probably won't reach you :/ , but I would love to see you to go really retro: Akai VT-100. And because of the Akai, some statements in the video are not quite correct."
4254,Man this series is awesome
4255,"Great series idea and all nicely presented and explained Mr B. I still have my Sony system with about 60 cassettes to be edited and put onto a DVD and just like music cassettes they do degrade with time.  There will be so much for future humans to see 200 years from now and families can see what their ancestors were really like instead of the staged pictures of Victorian times..
Back in the day it was a great experience to see a movie on the big screen, so much anticipation, you can imagine how people felt when the films  were turkey's. "
4256,MKBSD 😂
4257,"Marques, I've been following you for a while and I think this is the best video I've seen so far. Great job!! It showed the love and respect you have for your craft."

4340,"I had a camcorder that was from a few years after this, maybe '89. Before computers, I would create stop motion animations with just the camcorder; pressing the record button on then quickly off for each frame. I did the same thing as Casey, using the camcorder hooked up to a VCR to add in music or edit videos together. Sometimes I would even have the video I previously made playing on the TV, with the camcorder focused on the screen to record it while I did a voiceover or music. So much work!"

4375,This was pretty cool. It’s even cooler to see this now since I just put together for a video for my family for Christmas made up of old family VHS tapes. It was sorta surreal watching back on the tapes and converting them over to digital. Plus the VCR confused the hell out of me and I had lost all memory on how to use it lol.

4387,"Ok, the end freaked me out a little"
4388,"Considering the time it was made. The build of those cameras were pretty damn solid. My dad had a newer model that came with the VHS cassette loader. You could take the tape out of the cam, put it in the VHS loader and pop it in, watch it on your tv! Cool times back then."
4389,"22:04 ""Feel free to write a comment on a piece of paper"" lol"

4401,The intro alone made me absolutely love everything this series is about. Young Marques is probably one of the cutest kids of all time and watching the videos of you as a kid doing videos for YouTube is something I could watch in a video all of its own. I'm sure you won't ever read this as there's literally thousands of comments but it really put a smile on my face watching you do what you love. Keep up the amazing work Marques you are an inspiration to millions!
4402,Nice....

LOL i used to record just the screen of the t.v. and it went into a constant loop and was really weird on the 18"" wood panel t.v. we had. Oh and back then I WAS THE REMOTE. had to crank the knob on the t.v. and the knob was missing and had to use a wrench. Lol. I miss the days.

4444,Normally not a fan of casey but i love this collab marques! Love your channel man your an intelligent guy!!
4445,"I have a video of my 3rd birthday party (1986) that my dad took and it is the most sentimental thing I own because my dad died when I was six. He was the one recording, so you can only briefly see him in a mirror for a few seconds during the party. I recently rewatched it with my husband and after where you assume the video ends because it goes to static, there is another shot that I had never seen before of my dad sitting on the couch with me and I'm asleep. It made me cry immediately because I cannot remember him and there he (and I) was. The funny part was that at three I was sleeping in the same weirdly specific way I do now. It is amazing how little things like this old VHS tape can mean so much to someone."
4446,The footage from that camera can make everything feel like a 1980's video
4447,Didn’t the nazis have something similar way before it’s time

Hey, this camera you have there is an amateur device; with the professional version of it, you produce TELEVISION programming. You produce the part of TV shows that were recorded earlier to include in the show, the parts of the show that are not in the studio. Or sometimes an entire show like a documentary, e.g. a wildlife documentary. It's not a film camera. It's TV. What are you doing bringing up films and theaters?!"

""Feel free to write a comment on a piece of paper, put that in envelope.....and in 3 to 5 days, we'll get that comment"" :D  Editing with VHS was a nightmare because the wiping head could not wipe from frame zero and you could see both videos together for couple of frames. ( in MC recorder wiping head ( simple magnet ) was even 3cm on the left from writing coil magnet , so you could hear both songs for a second. )  Marques and Casey, you could show us ECHO neverending tape ( one writing coil and 4 reading coils ). That was such a simple idea and so perfect. Thx for the video and happy 2020."

4678,"Marques, try hold off on the Ageism man, show some respect, ppl from back then had to have ""balls"" to get anything done, if u were born back then u'd be flippin burgers somewhere. Btw there's a camera that precedes that one, it was a 2 unit machine, camera on your shoulder and separate full size tape VHS unit as a shoulder unit. That's not from a google search..We had one at our lab. You also missed consumer film cameras and edit desks (it's not ""film it"" it's ""video it""). ""very little technology and equipment""?? it's exactly the opposite, there's so much friggin tech today any idiot can do it, no barrier to entry. Your final edit shows how spoiled you are, all your lighting exposure is wrong because it's something you barely have to worry about now, maybe demo that to show how easy it is today... I could go on but man the vid definitely supports the stereotype of the arrogant spoilt brat hipster that is pervasive now (yeah you owe 99.99% to the past)."

Amazing that the OnePlus 6 I owned could shoot SIGNIFICANTLY better quality video than the camcorder in 1080P, and my current iPhone 11 does even better than the OnePlus! Phenomenal how far technology has come!"
4683,"I used to work for a company called Teletape in central London and we sold lots of VHS recorders.

4719,Most households did not have overhead lighting back when the activator came out. That said it still sucked even when it worked.

4745,19:25 Is the amount of time I had to wait to hear a brief mention of Streets Of Rage. This would explain the clueless guy inserting the cartridge with the power button ON.
4746,Hearing that “SEGAAA!” Brings up memories
4747,"Wait, what was this about again?  I can't stop obsessing over the fact that we've got Hannibal up in this business."
4748,(Me at the start of this video) I’m literally tearing up....  throughout the video
4749,I still remember playing streets of rage with my friend. Good times
4750,"""Thats why you talking to me like that""  Lol, Marqeus is baby."
4751,I can’t believe that the sega CD wasn’t mentioned.
4752,The interactor allowed you to have regular sound come out of the TV while pushing just the low end to the back pack. It was awesome.

4764,It was so cool to randomly find Jake here! You rock Baldino ! :D
4765,I remember when I used to own the Mortal Kombat Plug and Play it was a handheld game controller with a game programmed in it that you plug into your TV and it was the original mortal Kombat

4771,This is the first thing I've ever watched in YouTube premium. More of this
4772,"Our toy walkie talkies were wireless and barely worked,  imagine a wireless controller at this time was just a dream all we really cared about was playing, beating levels, and try not to die."
4773,So many feels.
4774,"Did anyone else feel the gigantic nerd energy wave that hit when that kid said ""it probably has better graphics."""
4775,I'm loving all these cameos you're bringing on. I was shocked to see Jake from gameranx!
4776,You can't talk about the Sega Dreamcast's failure without talking about the Saturn so it's a shame that wasn't mentioned. It's also worth mentioning the Dreamcast has a pretty substantial cult following. Overall though it was a great video about it's legacy
4777,"The fact that these ""gamer"" YouTubers don't know most of these games and peripherals...."
4778,"13:11 ""This is Dope or Nope""
Matthias and the rest of Hi5 Studios: That's not allowed..."

man ...running home with my brother after school to play Mortal Kombat ll ...i miss the 90s 😢"
4780,It’s crazy to know that a kid like me knows more about retro tech than most adults today
4781,Dreamcast next please 🥺
4782,Video Games became more than just toys with the Sega Genesis. Iconic and unforgettable.
4783,The first console I bought on my own was a genesis. $50 second hand in the mid 90s. Absolutely loved my Sega
4784,"Moonwalker game was so great, very rhythic game and trippy."

4788,"15:16 that reaction ""Ohhh my God, it kind of works"" was hilarious."
4789,"I had the interactor, I thought I was changing the game when I debuted it on Christmas. I remember the activator working surprisingly well."
4790,LOVE these videos man... I hope one day there’s a video that focuses on dreamcast! That system was so great but the life was tragically short :(
4791,"My favorite console. This thing gave me some of the greatest gaming experiences of my life, and I still go back to the games to this day. Shining Force 1 & 2, Phantasy Star 2 & 4, Streets of Rage 1-3, Sonic,  Vectorman, Outrun, Mortal Kombat, Columns, freaking Gunstar Heroes, Golden Axe, Shinobi. Just the variety and quality of these games were amazing, and they still hold up to this day."
4792,"I am so happy it's not 2020 so he can name my favourite Scorpion - ""I will play with the Corona guy!""."
4793,goosebumps very nostalgic

4795,I'm so obsessed with these retro tech videos
4796,"This brought back alot of memory,  I failed and repeated a whole year in high school, because of Sega and Nintendo games."
4797,"Man, the production quality on everything you do is phenomenal... i hadn't realized this series existed until i came across it today. Glad i found it though. love what you do Marques! BIG PROPS to you for getting Blake Harris in on this one, you always know how to get just the right guests"
4798,I don't know why I'm watching this. I actually lived through this.
4799,"""I'm 25""
""Oooo that's why your talking to me like that""🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
4800,"When I was really young (maybe 3rd grade?), I had a friend that was completely illiterate, and he wanted me to play this game that had this crazy and beautiful art style I'd never seen before that he had so I could tell him what it was about. It ended up being Shining Force, and it got me into strategy games and JRPGs and anime; all things things the Genesis was not in any way, shape, or form known for."
4801,I still remember sneaking out late Christmas eve night and tearing just the corner of the wrapping paper to see that black box and a white pinstripe that would be part of the grid pattern. That's all I needed. I went back to bed super excited! Mine came with Altered Beast.
4802,"Daaaamn! You got Hannibal AND Jake Baldino?? I love this.

4805,I still remember all the combos AND the brutality sequence of my characters. Come on!
4806,Robocop vs Terminator was one of my faves on Genesis. I had Gamegear too.

4812,this series makes me so happy. thank you marques

4829,Streets of Rage 2 got me into Genesis <3
4830,Oh and Power Stone on DreamCast was awesome.
4831,"The way Mari destroyed Marques with that Scorpion move reminds me of the days when I used to play Tekken 5, a bud of mine loved using Marshall Law and always beat me using his dash attack which is a fast kick."
4832,"When that SEGA fired up there was feels. The harmony with the white screen. Then, Bam, Sonic."
4833,"Okay, the moment you pulled on Blake Harris (Author of Console Wars), I knew that this entire video was legitimate. Well done."

4835,Im so envy for the condition you get that old tech in
4836,Thanks got posting this Marques. My first console was a Sega Genesis. Lots of good memories :)
4837,This dude turned the Sega on before putting in the cartridge.. That's a big no no and the reason it didnt work at first
4838,Shout out to the sneaker game in this video.  You and Jake should do a sneakers for gamers show.  I'd watch it.
4839,I used to play sega genesis in the early 2000's. streets of rage is my favorite game even now.
4840,I'm 24 and from Nepal so we got tech 5-6 years later than the US. So this was a great throwback for me. Definitely was a genesis fan.
4841,"Gustavo the drywall guy seems like a cool game, I would play it hahaha"
4842,Man I loved Moonwalker.  What an era
4843,You should have talked about the Sega Nomad. It was the handheld Genesis you could play on a TV. It was the first Nintendo Switch.
4844,Kudos for checking the beginnings!👍🏿
4845,"Hey marque! So this is retro tech now !  All these videos are
