0,Quality vid graham! Watched it all the way through!
1,MonkeyBoo LOVED doing the picks for Graham! It was great working with you guys! Can't wait to see the $$$ roll in
2,Where can I get a monkey?
3,"Monkey's got Tesla, hedging with Ford, he's smarter than he lets on"
4,Tesla is growing really fast. Netflix value went up by 15% after Biden became president. Cannot believe the money just randomly picked them.
5,"Great video. I have a poor portfolio and behind on my financial target. If you do your own investing, have you ever wondered whether you should turn things over to a professional? I have been pondering on the same question from stories hanging out on the news. How investors make millions in the marketplace using $100,000 only."
6,"It's freaky that RSG was chosen - Nikola just cancelled it's ""contract"" with the company for 2,500 garbage trucks today!   
But on a more serious note, I think that having TSLA as one of his picks is going to definitely skew the results Graham. XD"
7,"I love how open minded you are about investing, I read an article of investors that made good money within few months from shorting, so please I'd really love more tips and clues on how to outperform the market and make such profit using options."
8,"Reject modern stock picking, embrace monkey"
9,Monkey will win.
10,"Graham: ‘I only drink 20cents ice coffee’.  
Graham 2.0: ‘Guys today I spent 100k on a monkey’"
11,I will laugh like crazy if this monkey beats Jeremy at Financial Education
12,I dont believe it! to many cuts.
13,"It’s okay even though he loses 50% of that $100k, he will make recover + alpha within a month from this channel."
14,Ahahahahhahaa. This is brilliant 😂😂
15,"Call Cap 🧢. So in other words, M1 finance sponsored you for the 100 grand. Just keep it 💯"
16,Imagine having so much freaking money you can just casually drop 100k in a random game with a monkey 🐒
17,The same chant goes for this video as well as players on a BJ table. “Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!”
18,You just know the monkey is going to start a hedge fund.
19,This was awesome! Glad we could make this happen. Hopefully Monkey Boo beats the stock market!
20,I would have put Ford in the “F” tier...... sorry had to take the dad/investor joke
21,Best of luck!!! I see it's already going up and well!
22,"Ohhh!, I get it, sponsored video from M1 finance. Thank god, I was nervous he was actually going to use his own money."
23,"Mutual funds: temporary
Monke: forever"
24,Lmao how could I not click and automatically like this video.
25,"lost some credibility when $tsla got included in the GS30 index, then monkey picked tesla..no way I smell bs - smashing like -"
26,Hahahaha this was awesome! My prediction is that you'll beat the market in one year from today by at least 4% with this experiment 😉
27,"Me: picks random stocks
Monkey: picks random stocks
Both: pick ford"

32,"This is simply amazing, one of the best videos on youtube, so excited to see the updates on this"

34,Would love to see you do a review on Titan. Looks like an app for Hedge Fund investing.
35,This is great!! 😂😂 Had to try it for myself just to see how this portfolio would do. (Paper trading of course) 🤣
36,"You can tell someone is rich when they just put $100,000 in the air lol"
37,This is gonna be my favorite series. The Monkey Portfolio. I look forward the the monthly updates
38,"I spent all my money investing based on a monkey's decisions, that monkey is me"
39,I love the idea of using a random generator to select the stocks. I look forward to seeing what happens with this portfolio.
40,I will def come back to this video to see how well info did since the monkey had ultimate confidence that one . monkey for the win !!!! 🙏🙏🙏😎😎
41,This is the content we have all been waiting for Graham.
42,"This is great! Thank you for do this experiment.

50,"Wow ! This is how rich people spend the time when it’s bored?! Or this is the way they invest to be even richer ?!
We most buy that monkey first !!"
51,"Awesome tickle me excited, will be looking for updates. Really excited for the outcome, when i hear professionals and analysts and guru's spew there logic i always think about the monkey."
52,THIS IS AWESOME! Can't wait to see the results
53,"Avg person:

millionare:
""i'll give 100k to a monkey"""
54,"Graham get you some IMPX its rumoured to merge with mclaren. 0 downside, yes 0, it's an spac at the floor"
55,"HE DID IT!
It's good to know that the stock market can go up and down, but Graham never lies!"
56,Is it just me or do yall hear an x song in the background
57,"Was not expecting this, but I was not disappointed"
58,"In 1 year: Graham makes 50K on his investment

Jack: Asks monkey to teach him options trading 😂"
59,"damn, 100K ? that's like three times of my lifesaving. wish i can toss it out like its some pocket change :("
60,This video makes me wonder why I am paying such high expense ratios for an actively managed fund when a monkey can do the same job if not better. KEKW
61,This actually has a  very solid chance at beating the SP.  Great job Boo!
62,"Yeah, you finally mentioned M1Finance haha"
63,"Holy $h!t graham! This is probably your greatest video to date. It had everything. Money, a monkey, a tier list, and TESLA all wrapped into a relevant video lol nice"
64,"Hey Graham, can you do a video talking about the Chase Trifecta?? I’ve been seeing a lot of videos about it and I want to know what you think about it."

68,"Graham this is the content we need! Well done my friend, well done. Like button smashed itself"
69,"Graham, we need you to make a video on your top choices for mutual funds so we can compare against your top choices for index funds."

71,ooo oooo ohhhh ahh ahh ahhhhh!!! pounds chest
72,"Ugh! I spent this whole video thinking it was recorded in 2019 and that we were about to get the results! Oh well, curious how the little monkey does."
73,0:29 “Malkiel was wrong”
74,"This is awesome! I chuckled when I first read about the stock picking monkey in the book, but didn’t think I’d see it in action!"
75,Big Biaheza a vibes from this one. Now I want to see Biaheza reacting to millennial money 😁
76,Next year: “A Monkey doubled my money in one year!”
77,I think this is the most excited I’ve ever been for an update!! Literally can’t wait!! Team monkey haha
78,"This could have been a viral video if u included the end results aswell, looking forward following the journey tho!"
79,Thanks Graham Stephan for the recommendation i have have received my payment and my Xmas bonus.
80,Graham. This was fckin awesome. I loved the style of this video. Please do more like this
81,Monkey picked Tesla this is a sign it’s going to double again.
82,I love M1. you and Andre got me started in investing using M1.. it has been a great year for me as far as investing goes.
83,You know you've made it when the views from your video will more than make up for any losses the money actually makes.
84,"Amazing idea. I know
You’re worried that the views arnt don’t the best on this one yet but I honestly loved it. Can’t wait to watch a monkey beat the stock market!!"
85,Make a video on the update on your gains every month. yOuTuBe Ad mOnEy!!
86,This is epic (DBX and ARKK) TO THE MOON
87,This is actually how I pick my stocks except I use my cat.  It's worked out well so far!
88,Great editing on this vid
89,"Such a great video, I want this on trending 👀"
90,Monkey: “ Blow me a kiss for picking Tesla.”
91,Will you consider the revenue from youtube when evaluating the Monkey stock picking strategy. Interesting if it will payoff before and or after youtube.
92,Signed up to Webull for my two free stocks and downloaded the app. Anyone know how I actually get me free stocks?
93,"Hey graham, would love to see you react to GQ’s “How Austin Ekeler Spent His First Million in the NFL” if you really liked Tua, I know you’d love this guy!"
94,Been using M1 for almost a year been very happy with it
95,how would that 100k (and any changes to your account) count towards taxes since it is technically a business expense?
96,"jajaja great video Graham!!! loved it, keep up all the good work!"
97,"if you do an update video how things are going, you can call it ""monkey news"""
98,Blackrock is one of my favorite stocks.
99,"this is a great experiment Graham, I am rooting for this portfolio because it gives us amateur Investors a positive light."
100,"Let’s be honest, we didn’t ask for this but we loved it😂"
101,Honestly i wish you put in more lol. Got some nice picks there.
102,You're gonna easily finance it with at least 12 videos the upcoming year :P
103,"Out of 1,000 you got TSLA and NFLX, wow! I'm curious how this strategy will turn out."
104,Merry Christmas! Looking forward to seeing the updates on how these do!

106,Can't wait for the update!
107,"I’m emotionally invested in the monkey portfolio, what’s the update schedule for it gonna be like?"
108,"I HIGHLY recommend Graham's how to make YouTube videos program.  I bought it and LOVE it. (No, he didn't pay me to say this.)"
109,"My stock picking monkey is my cat. What ever stock her paws hit, I bought."
110,"Cool video, I’ll be watching 😂. 
I dunno about the tier system - picking based solely on growth potential? Any financials looked at or anything? You gotta buy them anyway so I suppose it doesn’t matter 😂"
111,You're great Stephen! I mean it. Absolutely stunning idea and awesomely crafted episode. Kudos to you Graham
112,"Graham : Be wise with yor money!
Also Graham  : gives it to MONKE"
113,"Graham, you should really do a video on the fact that Dave Ramsey publicly said on his radio show that he believes that Bitcoin can’t actually be cashed out for US dollars.  I have heard him give bad advice, but this is just insane."
114,Everyone smash the like button for Graham's Christmas gift and let's get this guy some watch time!!
115,LOL this is gonna be great. Hoping for the triple return of investment 🙏 🙌
116,I actually want to know how this will end
117,So dreams do come true! Am so fired up for this 😁
118,"No doubt this is creative and brilliant way in proving your point, love it. My takeaway on this video is just start investing even when you feel new or know nothing about investing. You’ll learn along the way. ❤️"
119,This is like someone doing DD on Wallstreet bets.
