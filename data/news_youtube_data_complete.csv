The poor fitting, ad hoc dust masks won't stop the new UK virus strain and it will take several months to vaccinate everyone with a vaccine that might not work, (e.g. resistant SA or Brazil strains), or need booster shots every few months. We need improved Hazmat Level C full face and half face respirators now. The improved respirators must include a P100 filter cartridge that screws onto the exhaust valve seat to prevent virus transmission from an infected wearer. Please use the DPA and legislation to increase production of respirators designed to prevent the spread of all COVID strains and save us from these dangerous dust masks. See Hazmat Level C:

""There were safety tests done in 2016 saying it's safe to take.""
Acetaminophen is safe to take too, but would you tell someone with acute liver failure to take it? No, because it would walk you to death's door a lot sooner than intended, and has been linked as a causation of the condition after extensive study. Perhaps Lindell is using oleandrin as a sugar replacement; would explain his mentality...

Just as every person who committed a crime during all protests, every person who committed a crime at the Capitol building on January 6th, 20201, should be held accountable.  The motivation for the protest in the first place was the loss of faith and confidence in the U.S. election system.  The true people behind this loss of confidence are those who deny an open forensic investigation of all mail-in ballots and vote-counting computers.

New details about Trump's efforts to overturn the election

Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark nearly convinced then-President Donald Trump to remove then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and use the Department of Justice to undo Georgia's election results, The New York Times reported.
Clark -- who appealed to the former President's false claims of election fraud -- met with Trump earlier this month and told Rosen following the meeting that the then-President was going to replace him with Clark. Clark would then move to keep Congress from certifying the election results in then-President-elect Joe Biden's favor, according to the paper.
Rosen demanded to hear the news straight from Trump, according to the paper, and arranged a meeting on the evening of January 3 -- the same day that Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the state official to find enough votes for him to win Georgia, came to light.
During the meeting, Rosen, another top Justice Department official and Clark gathered with Trump, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other lawyers. Trump had Rosen and Clark state their cases for him, the Times reported. The Times cited two officials who compared Rosen's and Clark's opposing arguments during the meeting to an episode of ""The Apprentice,"" Trump's old reality TV show.
Citing four former Trump administration officials, the paper reported that an agreement among department leadership that they would all resign if Rosen were fired helped sway Trump from removing his acting attorney general. The notion of department pandemonium, congressional investigations and blowback from fellow Republicans seemed to resonate with Trump, who after nearly three hours decided to allow Rosen to stay and determined that Clark's plan would not work, according to the Times.
CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Clark told the Times that its report contained unspecified inaccuracies and that he could not speak to his conversations with Trump or department lawyers.

Thank you for your TA, some of the best on YT. 2020 was quite a year, and what is a better news for crypto than to see all-time highs at the years end? Both institutions and high-net-worth investors are starting to acknowledge Bitcoin as a store of value and as a treasury asset. Happy to be a partaker of such a change in the world of crypto, I know some hodlers are happy at the moment due to the recent rise, although you aren't supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts. That's why it was never second-guessing when an opportunity as crypto tradlng came my way. ""Why hold a currency you can multiply or grow?"" With much energy channeled into tradlng bitcoin daily with the guide of Lawrence, it was no surprise how my portfolio went from 3 Bitcoin to 19 Bitcoin within a year. I will always advlse anyone who just started dealing with Bitcoin or old holders, Trade people! It is truly easy, only requires your time. I registered with a Crypto mentor on Te.leqram mssngr who helped me grow my crypto portfoIio all the way to the top. @Lawrencesmithfx on Te.leqram 0R wh*ts*pp+14153260873 He truly made 2020 a blissful one, now looking forward to the new yeap

He's used other peoples money and lawyers who twisted the law. He is no business genius. His clearly being held accountable will unite the country. Doubts keep the division. He was a distraction in an already broken system. Subtract him. Clean his stain off.

It's times like these that reinforce my choice to register as Independent, and refuse to vote anyways. What's an election if one side can simply shut down the competition at our expense, and no matter who wins...we're confronted with ceaseless violence from the masses who can start riots out of just a disagreement. Former President Trump was far from an ideal leader. We haven't had one in nearly 50 or so years, he was however, outside the political status quo and I took some comfort in that. The sheer level of corruption that was exposed in recent time, that a political party; currently the Democratic party can wield is astonishing...but it doesn't matter now that the Democrats control nearly everything.

Clark is trying to protect himself by claiming he believes there was a fix or rigging of the election, so therefore he was receptive to Trump's overtures about inserting him as AG for the purpose of trying to invalidate Biden's win. So, perhaps Mr. Clark will explain what evidence he collected that made him believe Trump's assertions were correct.

541,"Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark nearly convinced then-President Donald Trump to remove then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and use the Department of Justice to undo Georgia's election results, The New York Times reported.
Clark -- who appealed to the former President's false claims of election fraud -- met with Trump earlier this month and told Rosen following the meeting that the then-President was going to replace him with Clark. Clark would then move to keep Congress from certifying the election results in then-President-elect Joe Biden's favor, according to the paper.
Rosen demanded to hear the news straight from Trump, according to the paper, and arranged a meeting on the evening of January 3 -- the same day that Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the state official to find enough votes for him to win Georgia, came to light.
During the meeting, Rosen, another top Justice Department official and Clark gathered with Trump, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other lawyers. Trump had Rosen and Clark state their cases for him, the Times reported. The Times cited two officials who compared Rosen's and Clark's opposing arguments during the meeting to an episode of ""The Apprentice,"" Trump's old reality TV show.
Citing four former Trump administration officials, the paper reported that an agreement among department leadership that they would all resign if Rosen were fired helped sway Trump from removing his acting attorney general. The notion of department pandemonium, congressional investigations and blowback from fellow Republicans seemed to resonate with Trump, who after nearly three hours decided to allow Rosen to stay and determined that Clark's plan would not work, according to the Times.
CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Clark told the Times that its report contained unspecified inaccuracies and that he could not speak to his conversations with Trump or department lawyers.",news

This is so much history and I appreciate the work that went into making this. I cried thru the entire thing I can’t believe the hatred and pain that black people had to endure. I’m not black but I felt the pain as I watched this, enough to keep me crying thru all that I could handle. I couldn’t finish watching it because I had too much pain.

On July 6, 2016... I was scrolling through information about Eric Garner feeling hopeless about what I could do... and then I clicked on the live video of Philando Castile. I hope this recent uprising changes something. I hope something gives in favor of the people, because none of us are faring well these days.
